=== Project Updates ===

=== Consensus items ===

=== Discussion Items ===
==== Dr. Bobby ====

Dr. Bobby? Shannon: Dr. Robert Owens is self-doctored. Has been showing up at NB and being disruptively schizophrenic (yes, we have another one). Shannon removed him fom the space. He followed Shannon across San Francisco. Shannon got on BART; he had a ticket. Shannon entered an access-controlled building and let security handle him.

Friday: rummaging through spare parts bins attempting to build an NSA supercomputer. We let him take the PCI network card and an old PCMCIA card. He left Applied Cryptography.

Saturday: someone escorted him "the hell" out.

Sunday: came back; police came and took him away. SFPD knows Dr. Bobby very well.

Zedd turns trains on back.

Shannon: Bobby shows clear signs of schizophrenia.

We've had this discussion before. If people feel endangered, they should do what they need to do.

He's been coming here for two months. He's been sitting at a computer looking at camps and stuff.

In general, having the police here is undesirable. On the other hand, feel free to avail yourself of the emergency structures of San Francisco.

Executive summary: If he creeps you out and you don't want to deal with it, post to IRC and see if someone wants to deal with it. If no one volunteers, call the police probably.

Related update: Erin got out of the hospital but is now shacked up with a friend in the south bay. Hacker Dojo?

Anonymous piece of cardboard: guy seeking help on that thing sitting next to Mike. His name's Anthony. Words illegible. He's got some Google stuff. The cardboard piece is on the apparatus next to Mike. It is an apparatus to keep a container of water at a specific temperature. He said he'd be back.

==== Frantisek ====

Did some changes to the fridge. The big fridge is now just drinks. Use the non-big fridge for non-drinks.

==== Shannon: treasurer ====

Treasurer's term is up. We need a new treasurer. Kelly has volunteered to step up. Next week we will be officially consensing on letting Kelly manage our money. (Other people can totally step up.) In the absence of anyone else, we're going to force Kelly to do it next week.

==== Moxie: October 2 ====

Week from this Saturday, Noisebridge anniversary party is here. Moxie could use some help with it -- specifically with promotion. Only fun if you have at least 100 people here. Moxie's just moved back, so he's not well-positioned to market it.

Party starts at 7:30. Deciding what to do with the money is only half of it, and we're playing music and stuff too. Does anyone have weird mad-science-y projects to put up in the space? If so, talk to Moxie.

=== End of Meeting ===
* Put back the membership binder by the Shrine at the northeast corner.
* Save the meeting notes to the wiki.
* Send a copy of the meeting notes to the discussion list.
* Copy the [[Meeting Notes Template]] for next week's agenda and update the main wiki page's link to it.
* Enjoy a cocktail with your fellow hacker or robot.
