= Safe Space =

'''Note:''' This section is experimental.  We discussed it at [[Meeting_Notes_2016_06_28]]. We're going to try it for the next meeting, and see how it goes, and then discuss in the discussion section how it went, and how we'd like to tweak it.

Noisebridge is a safe space.  '''Invite a volunteer to describe''' what that means.

Some specific points you might prompt the group to touch on, if it doesn't happen naturally:
* What to do if you feel uncomfortable.
* Noisebridge strives to be radically inclusive. What does that mean?
* Noisebridge has an anti-harassment policy. What does that mean?

Noisebridge where everyone is respected and feels safe,
bring it up if you feel unsafe or disturbed
there are posters that explain the 
see something say something
don't harass people


= Participation =

Invite a knowledgable volunteer to describe who can participate at Noisebridge, including:
* Describe how to get an rfid key for the door system
* Describe how to get access to slack

General
everyone is welcome
dont need to be a member
can do everything here
please donate, but necessary

please open the door, but the person that is let is let in on your authority, you are responsible, if they seem sketch don't open the door

slack channel (like irc but looks better I guess) for 
need RFID



= [[Philanthropist|Philanthropists]]=
* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philanthropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

like a general member but you donate and have a few responsibilities and perks
have to close up if you are the last one
you have 24 hour access token

80 dollars normal month
40 for starving hacker

Easier then member
need one member to vouch for you


= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

Is not like gym
it is a commitment to make noisebridge better
get to help make decisions in the consensus process
to be a member means you are going to help noisebridge, and know how noisebridge works
fill out form get two member to vouch for you
takes four week of meeting
if no one objects after fourth meeting 

can add rfid to people you trust

= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank: 70k+
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

less then 7000 per month operating

= Consensus =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

Concensus 
whenever there are important issues

two types large C- when ever there are any big issues the go through two weeks of deliberation tell people agree, or they can block it.

Do-ocracy do what you want to do-

blocking is a big deal, one block will halt that item instantly (only do it if you think it will ruin the space (IE lets set the building on fire)).


== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''


= Discussion =

Longer discussion items belong here.  This is the last part of the meeting so that people can break off and continue their discussion afterwards.

Mark- Video game library

Games are cool but are not always about creativity
