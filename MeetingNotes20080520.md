'''Agenda''':

Let's do this thing.  And what better day than Tuesday, the regular 
meeting day?
 
I'm hoping we can simply open up the wiki and write the changes in, all 
of us together.  I have a projector and I know how to use it - we can 
simply show the wiki on the wall.  Highly visible.
 
Rachel's house (it's full of projects but whose isn't, really?)

Be there or be uninterested in the dull task of writing legalese!
