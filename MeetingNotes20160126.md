* Steve: lurking here for years, only been a dozen times, software engineer, organizer for SF Bay Area Vegans in Technology (sfvtech.org). If you are vegan talk to me; we have a meetup. I came for the Docker thing afterward and happy to stumble into a meeting.
* Carl Maxwell: Software engineer- web development. As a hobby, I do video game development and creative writing. Heard about it googling for hackerspace.
* Jeanie: 2 track career, exhibition design in museums and galleries and work for nonprofit gallery in SF. My past is in art conservation and preservation over long periods of time so I am in permanent spaces and archives. I am interested in this space as intersection of art and science. This place is fantastic I've been a couple times to work and pretend like I know how to sew this is my first meeting thanks for having me.
* Roger: I've been here months. By day data analyst, by night still doing dataish things
*LOL*
* Geoff: ProgrammerQ on slack and online. Sysadmin devops spec by day, work for Docker, also teaching class here about docker after meeting. I like teaching, solving problems, by night I enjoy building mechanical things 3D printers stepper motors and that sort of thing.
* Chris: Been coming a year now, do game development stuff.
* Max: Doing software and hardware, first time, heard about it from hackerspace in France.
* Henner: I come now and then. I like to write software, play with hardware and CNC machines and 3d printers.

It's okay I guess, I think it's fine as long as you have good version control 
* Alex: I'm Alex, teach robotics as an interest group. on tuesday, teach songbridge, and then afterwards gamebridge with C#. If you like signage, I like it too! 
* Torrie: Coming to NB for 2 years at this point. I do secretarial things, update tokens and RFID badges sometimes touch money sometimes it goes into the bank. By day I'm human by night I sleep.

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to explain''' [[Noisebridge_Vision|what Noisebridge is about]]:
&lt;blockquote>Noisebridge is a 501c3 nonprofit that provides a space for creation, collaboration, and learning about technology and creative projects. Noisebridge provides space, power tools, and infrastructure to help the public learn new skills and create cool things. Noisebridge continues to exist through and depends entirely on membership fees and donations. Our code of conduct is 'Be excellent to each other'."&lt;/blockquote>
* Introduce any experimental or unusual moderation techniques that may be using during the meeting like: direct responses, limited speaking time, orderless stack, &amp;c.
* Round of introductions (remember, announcements come later):
** What's your name
** What do you do
** What do you maintain at Noisebridge?
** if you are new: how did you hear about Noisebridge?


= Short announcements and events =
* Hack the left - hackathon happening 5th to 7th of february. This is special because of leftist, anticapitalist, radical lefitst projects/problems. (Is that different than tonight) Yes/no, more poeple with the same purpose.
* Hack the future - Cofounded w/people from Hacker Dojo. Aimed towards children. If you want to teach kids, come to Alex. Check out [hackthefuture.org]
* If you're a dev, haven't been to a GameJam, check out Global Game Jam this weekend. Don't teach kids.
* PyClass, Noisebridge's Python class is starting up next monday, February 1st. If you're starting to learn python, hurry up so you can be prepared for this **intermediate** class. We're not covering important stuff, we're covering cool stuff! 6-week module that resets every 8-10 weeks. If you miss this session, come back in 8 weeks. It's ok if you miss a week during the course.
* A new donation feature thing on donate.noisebridge.net! Noisebridge is a 501c3 and tax writeoffs are a big incentive. donate.noisebridge.net/projects lets you create a project so people can donate to particular projects you've proposed!
* Create Electronics Supplies Project lets you donate to help get LEDs, microcontrollers, circuitry and things to keep in a locked closet which we can sell to people attending classes. If you want to contribute to classes having a steady supply of parts for participants, go to donate.noisebridge.net/projects. [[LEDs]] has the details.
* The dark room is now a hole where there used to be walls. We're building a metal shop called the Sparkleforge and you should come contribute to building it.
* Docker class one shot after tonight's meeting, another class can be taught on request in the future.
* Pradeep: I and a friend in Mexico have an education project accepted by Singularity University. We want to go beyond one mentor per class to have multiple mentors in a class...
* Every other thursday there's a scrum meeting to go over Trello board to get things done like directly helping grant writing meetings. Show up Thursday at 7PM.

* Cool new projects? Something you'd like people to know? Say now, but keep it short! One or two sentences please!
* Any happenings at the space of which members should be made aware.
* Don't hog everyone's time since we all just want to hack!

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =
* Membership is the pinnacle of belonging to Noisebridge community where you are effectively taking legal responsibility for governing this 501c3. We have levels below that called Philanthropy where you also get 24 hour passes and donate.
* To become a member you have to be signed off by 2 existing members. Your names are read off 4 weeks in a row then consensus decision is made to accept you or not as a member.
* Philanthropist isn't a lower level, just a different thing. Membership in NB isn't like a gym membership because it isn't required to come, membership is more like stewardship in the community making sure it remains a safe effective place where we're excellent to each other and hack on things. Members are very trusted to be stewards of that core philosophy. Being a trusted person usually takes time.
* Membership has a specific legal definition within state of California to do with board votes, taxes, and more we could get into.
* Philanthropy begins with having a present member vouch for you. Philanthropists are responsible for closing the space at night as the last 24-hour-access person in NB. If a member knows you well enough to vouch for you. you too can become a philanthropist! Current donations are $80/month, or $40 for a starting member.

* Jay wishes to become a member. Who knows Jay?  (Torrie does). Jay is not here, but he'll be here in a few weeks. Sponsored by Torrie and Patrick.
* 2 philanthropists: Nick Hohman. Once signed, this Matthew^W Nick Hohman becomes a philanthropist. *no objection* Congratulations, you're a philanthropist.
* Who will speak in favor of Jeffrey Carl Faden Any objections? no. Congrats, Jeff. He's in the back.
* Anyone else? (Josh: Me!)
* Josh Lin has applied for philanthropy. Torrie sponsors. Josh is a philanthropist before actually filling, or starting to fill out his philanthropist application form. Truly miracles can happen at Noisebridge. (I just recurring donated!)

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

= [[Philanthropists ]] =
* '''Invite a knowledgeable member to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

= Financial Report =
*Noisebridge has about 6 moneys. We don't know what that is in American dollars.
* Please give us money. We have no money. Please help.
* Noisebridge is interested in looking at money for a grant. Check it out.
* Always looking for more people to help with the treasurer position, because the current treasurer is burn the fuck out. &lt;insert fire emojis here>
* We have no hierarchy, no gods, no masters. Only sentients.
* (Have we ever had a grant?) No. Never. We don't even know anyone named Grant. Someone brought in a $50 bill once. That's the closest we have to grants. My hacker space in Ohio got a grant for $15k for doing fuck-all.


= Consensus and Discussion =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

== Discussion Items ==

If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

* Discussion items?
* Alex: Last week we raised $80 to make up for some stolen tools (Torrie: Let's talk about that)
  * Stealing has traditionally been a problenm at noisebridge. An idea is to come up with combo lockers to help contain valuable tools to groups of people. Torrie is in favor of discussing this, even though there are 3 noisebridges. any discussants or should I begin a Spiel?
  **The Spiel Commences** 2 years ago, NB sucked. Closed for a month, turned out to be a year. Crackheads doing cocaine, homeless people coming on the street. Tragedy of the commons: Poor enforcement of things like theft, so theft happened all the time. Shit was getting stolen. Angle grinder (?) stolen, possibly as painful as anal bleaching. We have lockers, which has worked out pretty well. Currently we are Malloc()ing lockers. Shit is probably sold. #SorryNotSorry.
  * Goal is to get common lockers where people know the word and can get stuff out of it. We can expand those things. People are open to (fuck I lost my train of thought glhf). If anyone has better ideas, please come forth and volunteer.
  > * I'm into the scanning system. That might alleviate issues with paper things being stolen. When I went into the old darkroom, we had things like a banker's box of analog circuit diagrams. If you want to check me, fine. (Torrie: You don't seem shifty.) Still though.
  * Speaking of the book scanner, we might want to lock up the cameras while this is swill a work in progress.
  * Trent: One issue: the elevator door is propped sometimes, usually durong events. This doesn't need to happen anymore, we installed a doorbell. (Alex says he will make a sign encouraging people to not prop the elevator door open.)
  * Torrie: It is everybody's responsibility to ensure NB remains healthy. If you see someone sneaking in, greet them and talk to them and build a human interaction. This will be very helpful in finding who's cool and who's not. (Roger: FWIW my work encourages this exact same thing for the exact same reason). It's important that we have this personal trust. It's awesome to be able to leave their laptop and have it be there tomorrow. We don't have that yet. One time I left my laptop out for 2 days and it was still there. Not even bugged (jk I'm fbi).
  * Torrie; We should start (I am starting?) a security workgroup to start dealing with this.
  * Roger: My work encourages the same thing. If we see someone we don't recognize we greet them to catch sneaky people off the street.
  *mari-remote: as someone who has had stuffstolen, i am for these lockers
* Ruslan: By the way that RFID reader is kind of sketchy (Torrie: Yeah, that's a work in progress) (Roger's note: See discussion in slack, especially in #security-wg)
* Alex: We have a locker donation thing at [donate.noisebridge.net/projects/lockers]!
* Torrie: There is also a page of people who are 86'ed. This is a list of people who should never ever ever ever be allowed back into the space. We had a guy who literally dismantled a camera and basically shut down the space, we had a person who bit Mitch's thumb, a bunch of bad people.
* On Thursday, we have a SCRUM meeting, where we're getting together at 7 and looking at stuff on the Trello board.

* Nick asks where the Curry that Torrie was eating before the meeting came from. Torrie clarifies that it came from Alhambra on 16th street
