= Consensus and Discussion =

(Patrick introduces Consensus)

* Mitch proposes the unbanning of Lee Sonko
** Mitch: Lee was banned during some really unexcellent times in noisebridge's past.
** Kevin: At the time, NB introduced our anti-harassment policy. Just to add context, the person who did the ban did in fact feel harassed by Lee. However, that was a long time ago.
** Torrie: Today's the first day I've ever met Lee and they don't give any big red flags or negative vibes. So they've at least fooled me that much. Seems fine to me :+1:
** Patrick: Most of the historical record around Lee's banning was a discussion between two people. Didn't feel like consensus, its very murky, and there is little evidence that it was legitimate.
