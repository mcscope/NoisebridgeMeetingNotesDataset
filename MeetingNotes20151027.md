= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

*Mari:
  Being a member means taking extra responsibility for the space. You can come in and hack the space for free 24/7.
  You can also become a philanthropist which is a separate thing to get 247.
  Being a member gives you the right to come into the space and have consensus blocking rights to protect the space. The main thing is to donate your time and monetary support.  
  *Patrick: The application process starts with the binder under the display case. Pick it out and fill out a membership application form. You make a statement about what you want to do at Noisebridge. You ask for two members in good standing to sponsor you in becoming a member. For four weeks, your application is read aloud to people and people hearing it can acknowledge that it sounds like what you are all about. After 4 weeks, if you have the 2 requisite sponsors your application becomes a consensus item. Basically, members ask you lots of questions such as "Are you a cop" and "Are you allowed to say if you are a cop". A conclave without you present decides and when you come back it is consensed by Consenso to bless you as a member.
Your application can sit in the binder up to 12 weeks before it is taken out and you can reapply later.
    [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.

= Consensus and Discussion =

* The consensus process at Noisebridge is how we run things. Noisebridge as an organization values the opinions of members and community. We work together to find solutions to problems that will work for as many of the people in the community as possible. As opposed to majority rule voting which leaves out people in the community, we seek all opinions and are stronger for it by not cutting lose people with diverse viewpoints. 
It is one of the principles of Noisebridge that is fundamental. The way it works is, ideally, someone comes up with an idea that requires more than being doocratic about it that would affect the entire community in some way. They start by discussing it with the members of the community to build a proposal that will be excellent and solve the problem of the community. 
The proposal is then brought to the meeting and discussed. The propsal is explained, questions answered, and the proposal is adjusted. Once the proposal language is worked out, it is ready to be discussed at the following meeting for approval or further revision. Once a proposal is settled at a meeting, it can be consensed on the next so that everyone has time to understand it before the final consensus is made on it. It can be revised or dropped depending on how the process goes. Members have final say in the consensus process and many times non-members' viewpoints have influence over the discussion, but it requires members to make a decision and members have the right to block a decision. This happens rarely when a member has objections that cannot be addressed by modifications to the proposal yet.
Ideally, when someone gets to the point that they are blocking the proposal, it usually means that the discussions that would form a consensus-worthy proposal haven't been concluded yet. Most good consensus decisions are clearly the will of the space and de-facto in effect before the consensus ratifies them.

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.
* Conflict resolution is usually handled in mediation private talks between individuals and mediators

''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''
