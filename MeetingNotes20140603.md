== Cory w4 consensus discussion ==

I enjoy the openness of Noisebridge. Spend a good bit of time here. Want to put my money where my mouth is. I bring conflict mediation skills and prior experience in the non-profit world.
&lt;br> What's a hackerspace?  This
&lt;br> How can we improve Noisebridge? Throw my hat in for Secretary.
&lt;br> When do you see yourself blocking? I would sooner walk away than block.
&lt;br> Who sent you? Who are you working for? I have my motivations. I want to learn Unix and such.
&lt;br> Do you think it is fair to say that as a general guideline that banning due to personality clashes is appropriate? No.
&lt;br> Monad proxy blocks. Will discuss in person or private with Cory further.

''(Add any items which pass or are blocked to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

=== Affirm repository as accurate Noisebridge consensus ===

After minor edits to the pull request, consensus was reached.

==== Consensed ====


=== Access policy Week 1 ===

Noisebridge should be as open as possible.

I like the simple wording.
&lt;br> More accurately reflects reality.
&lt;br> Language could use some more umph. Perhaps a stronger statement of values...
&lt;br> Suggested change "Noisebridge is open, when it is not closed"
&lt;br> Excellence remains over arching norm.
&lt;br> Author is open to updating the language, more discussion, a working group, invites anybody to modify the wiki.

==== Will return next week ====
