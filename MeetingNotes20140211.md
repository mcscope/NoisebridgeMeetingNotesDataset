===Ban E. Bandersnatch===

===Ban RAYC===

Text:&lt;br>
For a period of 6 months starting February 18, 2014, RAYC is unwelcome at Noisebridge. He is prohibited from entering the space or participating in the community during this period.

RAYC put himself in direct personal danger. This is unexcellent. He has made valuable contributions to Noisebridge. Hence, a 6 month break and not a permenent ban is in order.

RAYC prefers to see action taken other than a mandatory break. RACY agrees not to sleep at Noisebridge again, on the elevator or otherwise.

RAYC is a good person to have at Nightbridge
