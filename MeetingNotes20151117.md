Eric:
    New safety program developed to stem damage to equipment in space. New posters floating around. Name and sponsor for short training for tools to ensure people learn how to use the tools.
    When we finally get new laser cutter, you can't touch it till you learn the skills.

    John: How often is training?
    Trent: Discussion after.
    
    Trent: Book barcode scanning app is over here. I can show you how to use it if you're interested. The goal is to scan all the books barcods, about 2000 books, all the blue taped sections have been scanned, we'd like it done in a couple weeks and we need now labor. If anybody can help we'd love to have you, after meeting we'll teach how!
    
    Alex: Five minutes of fame team reformation, come talk to me!

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

Alex: Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>

= End of Meeting =

Post meeting discussion of safety:
    
    Eric: When working at PS1 and for Argon LAbs I learned the lockout procedure.
    
    If a machine is in maintenance mode, it means don't touch it while its being worked on.
    
    They have a clamp from ULine, you put a colorized lock on the machine till you are done with it so no one can break it.
    
    Stop work authority: You can tell someone doing something on a machine that's problematic to stop and listen to safety information.
    
    Everyone has ability to ask people to slooow down and preserve the machines and do their work later.
    
    They might do things differently, but the people who have the most accidents are the 10K+ hours riders who become lazy intermediates who take more chances.
    
    They still go through the standardized explanation.
    
    John: Culturally, how do we make this not being told not to touch anything?
    
    John: I run the book scanning group and I would like anybody to be able to use the book scanner.
    
    Eric: Understood. The idea of the "don't teach an asshole" culture is when each person trained can train anyone they sponsor their trainees and they'll be careful not to train people who are known to be irresponsible that you'd be accountable for.
        
    John: I see how some tools like laser cutters and 3D printers need some tutorials to make sure people don't break their moving parts or start fires, the book scanner is quite safe and easy to use and I think a poster with instructions for it is sufficient.
    
    Eric: Great.
    
    Alex: I'd be happy to help make the poster as readable as possible to make learning how to use the scanner easy and inviting.
    
    Patrick: This is a laser. Do not stick your eye in it! Good instructions for people to sign off on before playing with it.
