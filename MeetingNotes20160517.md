Igal

Here with TOM, who's been creating makeathons for people with disabilities.Had 8 72-hour makeathons last year, combining hackers and occupational therapists. Products for people w/disabilities are usually super-expensive and/or unavailable. We can do better. We've done makeathons in Asia, ME, South America, and Africa soon. We have a meetup next monday 6PM-9PM at Google Embarcardero Campus (1 Market/ 345 Spear, 5th Floor)
There's an eventbrite: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tom-community-meetup-creating-os-technology-for-people-with-disabilities-tickets-25371904048

Chris notes the slightly uncomfortable heat.
Ryan (from SF) encourages Chris to make his own fan.
I am very slightly sweaty.


= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

Nobody applying right now. Which is fine! With small power comes great responsibility!

= [[Philanthropists]]=
* '''Invite a knowledgeable member to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

Andy Grosser, Sponsored by Mitch
No objections!

John Graham, Sponsored by Trent
No objections!

= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank:
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

Donate. Donate donate donate. Patrick will be back this month. Donate donate donate donate donate money. https://noisebridge.net/donate

Noisebridge has (as of last week) $42,000 in the bank. That's a lot, but presumably there's a huge amount scheduled for the Laser project. It's big. So big that we have to modify the building and pay customs, duties, shipping.
* https://donate.noisebridge.net/projects/laser
> Is this related to the Sparkleforge?
Sorta.


= Consensus and Discussion =
* When we have something taht is important to Noisebridge or contentious and worth discussing, we can bring it up and decide if it should go forward or be blocked. Any member present at meeting can block a consensus item. A thing about block is it is not a legistlative block that kills items, it indicates a schism within community. A block is a strong statement that if the decision goes as is, someone will leave Noisebridge. The point is to come up with a decision we can live with. Blocks are used sparingly and discussed outside CAPITAL C consensus process in conversational little C consensus process. NB got torn up about blocks in the past and now we try to do it constructively to propose modifications.
* You can also always block a new member applicant.
* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

No consensus items

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

== Discussion Items ==

If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

Drew
Jason Kirk wanted to ask if anyone was usign the disassembled shelving in the Trash area

Alex:
    We are making a hackerspace app - a 3d hackerspaces browser! If you are a web developer with API JSON experience, we could use your help tonight.
    
Victoria:
    I'm starting a hackerspace in West Oakland/Fruitvale. If you are interested, hit me up.
    Victoria has a crane..???!??!
    Chris is also helping out with this

Ryan (from SF):
    Consortium 22-  A social network for hackerspaces and makerspaces. It's a collaborative network, in order to do much larger-scale projects.
