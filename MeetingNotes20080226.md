I (Mitch) got to the meeting late, but here's what happened while I was there (as I remember it):

Jake gave everyone Casio F-91W-1CR watches.  These are the watches that people in Afghanistan were sent to Guantanomo for wearing.  Evidently wearing a watch in Afghanistan makes one a terrorist.

Jake and Bill demonstrated their system for Cold Boot Attacks on Disk Encryption, pretty easily getting the password from Rachel's Mac notebook.

Discussion about some of the potential hacker spaces that Andy, David, and Mitch checked out on Sunday, all near Mission &amp; 8th St.

People donated $65 to help pay for the lawyer we will be meeting with this Thursday to help us choose an appropriate corporate structure.  We are choosing between public benefit, mutual benefit, LLC and S Corp.
