Meeting Notes 2012-01-10 
 == HOWTO run a meeting. ==

Pick a moderator, and a note-taker. The note-taker should:

* write notes in this page, put them back up online when they're done,
* edit the [[Current_Consensus_Items|Current Consensus Items]] if anything is decided to be up for consensus next week (stuff raised for consensus this week should be publicised for a final decision next week)
* edit the [[Consensus_Items_History|Consensus Items History]] if anything was consensed or failed to consense this week.
* tell treasurer@noisebridge.net and secretary@noisebridge.net if there are new members.

Moderator should:
* make sure everyone gets a chance to speak
* speak minimally themselves
* keep the meeting moving! you're in charge of summarising the consensus, and/or suggesting things that need to be done!
* get the membership binders and ensure they are returned to the black desk

=== Discussion Items ===
====PG&amp;E====
For the last three months, we have been making steady progress, in the wrong direction. We were below 3MW, and now we're above 3MW. One or both of our circuits have been converted to smart meters, so that might have had an effect. We don't have the data from the smart meters soon EVEN THOUGH TELEVISION ADVERTISING SHOWS PEOPLE LOOKING AT GRAPHS.

Apparently television may contain lies.

Ben attributes some of the usage to lighting repair.

Also some people because of the construction have been using the halogen lamps. Stop this.

We haven't yet got power monitoring in. SuperQ and Jake blame vendors. SuperQ also blames Jake. Jake blames cats.

RayC says "curtains". He has looked for thermal leaks with Mike's thermomommeomomeeter and curtains would be the best solution.

====Noisetor====
* Consensus item for next week:  Now that Noisetor has undergone a trial period of operation, Noisebridge should extend the authorization of the Noisetor project to allow it to continue operating indefinitely.  (Proposed by MCT, Andy, Leif)
**Danny says he was under the impression that we were going to extend the noisetor consensus for a longer period of time, but that creating an indefinite commitment is not conducive to the consensus process since it's hard to unconsense something.
**Kelly is concerned that Noisetor folks have only recently instituted sufficient bookkeeping to track their balance, and that she would like this to be a more solid, regular practice before an indefinite consensus.
*Matching funds for Noisetor donations should go to Noisetor.
**Noisetor people Andy and Leif are uncomfortable calling Noisetor donations earmarked because this may have some other legal definitions.
**It is pointed out that Noisetor will be setting a binding precedent, under god, for matching donations for other Noisebridge projects that have separate funds.
====stuff====
*Rayc says there is a garbage pile. Put your garbage there. Take non-garbage out. Purge Noisebridge.
*people want space heaters at night
**apparently lease forbids this (no one can confirm this -- maybe it's the insurance?)
**Kelly donated large lined curtains last year which disappeared. 
*might seek donations for curtains
**moving blankets!
**Rayc will email discuss list
====taking over the nb hacker hotline====
*no one knows what this is. We suspect Danny.
*Danny texted saying to look on the wiki (but a wiki search for "hotline" turns up nothing recent)
====SF Free University People====
*Joe and Alan are visiting, want to use the space for classes.
**Joe is teaching a PKD class, there's also a creative writing class.
*[http://freeuniversitysf.org/ They have a website].
*Looking to consolidate their classes in the mission district (have historically been all over town)
*Several people point out that classes taught at Noisebridge should be open to all
*Rayc is open to "sponsoring" free university events at Noisebridge
*Joe and Alan will read the wiki page on [[Hosting an Event]].
**post to the announce mailing list
**make a wiki account
**keep a wiki page up to date (and the front page)
====Board Elections====
*Today is the last day to nominate &amp; confirm: [[Board Nominations 2012]]
*Leif is going to propose another method for the election. He will link a description here and send an email.
