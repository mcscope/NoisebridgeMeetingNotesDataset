 &lt;!-- best practices for meeting notes template.  
 #1 copy the template to the correct date for the upcoming meeting
 #2 edit the meeting notes date to reflect the date of the meeting
 #3 edit the meeting number to reflect the nth meeting of Noisebridge 
 #4 (wish all this was programmatic!)
 #5 this page often 'dead-ends' and is consequently difficult to navigate usefully.  Add and update links in the meeting notes template as necessary to make the notes more dynamic and useful for all

=== Announcements ===

Scheme language meetup -- anyone interested in exploring the Scheme programming language? I just donated a book "The  Little Schemer" to the Noisebridge library, and would like to use this and [http://wiki.call-cc.org/ Chicken Scheme] as starting points. [[User:Johnm|johnm]]

The Little Schemer donated to Noisebridge.  The Little Lisper also donated to Noisebridge.

Kelly recommends John post a call for a learning group to noisebridge-discuss.

Kelly recommends Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

=== What's Going On at Noisebridge ===

=== Project Updates ===

Spacebridge is starting back up again!
*  Have a reasonable payload with photographic equipment, releasing into upper atmosphere
* Last one landed 100 feet from a jail, but the payload was retrieved without incident.

=== Consensus items ===

None.

=== Discussion Items ===

*I am asking if the person managing postmaster@noisebridge.net is authorized to unilaterally discard freelance opportunities, job positions,etc. emailed. Cynthia lee

Cynthia's first email was blocked as spam: the given mailing list was not under noisebridge authority, and it's not obvious how this can be avoided without causing other issues, and does not seem to be a general noisebridge issue so far.  If it's a persistent social problem, will revisit.

*What could we have done better with regards to last week's consensus process and the do-ocracy that preceded it? ([[User:Hurtstotouchfire|Hurtstotouchfire]] will facilitate)

Last week: dramatic consensus banning someone from community for the first time, and was suggested to have more discussion about how NB could have handled that better.  Since there are very many new people and not so many regulars, Kelly suggests deferring it to next week. Any objections?  Deferred.

=== End of Meeting ===

End of meeting: NOISEBRIDGE IS AWESOME.
