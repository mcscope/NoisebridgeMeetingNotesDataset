* Week 4+ for Ryan Rising (present!)

= DISCUSSION: Ryan Rising (sponsored by Lyra and Kevin) =

Ryan's application for membership did not reach consensus.

* Learned about NB 2 years ago via Occupy SF; interested in robotics as kid; become interested in permaculture (growing for earth care, fair share, people care) since robotics tied to military; wants to do direct action and organize for social justice; interested in drones for moving supplies; interested in sound
* Will use consensus during Occupy SF; appreciate 100% consensus because blocking isn't for disagreeing, is if "harmful towards organization or people in it"; block if physically harm another human being; would wait 1-2 years before blocking; needs to learn more about NB before blocking
* Will try to be best person he can be to resolve conflicts, hopes other people will too; learned about mediation in college
* Thinks the best thing for NB is to communicate it to others, make sure others know it exists; clean bathrooms, organize
* Will tell others if not being excellent (kicked someone out last week for sleeping in utility closet)
* Wants to be member to participate more, do more, not necessarily meetings but to have common agency over space, make space feel welcome to others
* His friends have sound equipment, would like to have second fundraiser at a separate space to help sponsor members who cannot afford
* Can't think of issue/proposal he would block; would block if NB hacked food stamp system so others could not eat

= Financial Report =
None since key members are absent.

= Consensus items =

== Consensus Items From Last Week ==
* YES = Up to $1000 for Mitch for Tshirts: American Apparel for men, Gilden for women
* NO = Danny for Treasurer, Tom for Secretary, Snail for President: Enough discussion? = NO (email discuss? + more notice)
* YES = Banning Shawn Landden is barred from Noisebridge and community (including online)
>> Thanks to Alex for his courage in raising the issue (since he did not know at the time that other victims existed, and since by raising the issue others felt comfortable to speak up)
