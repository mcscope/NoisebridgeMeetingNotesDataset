We had about 15 people at the meeting.  (I don't think anybody counted                                                                                                        
or took pictures.)  The food was a success (although there was about 1.5

The discussion focused on two major areas:

We spent about 45 minutes (in several chunks) talking over people's                                                                                                           
ideas, plans, aspirations, and inspirations.  The following ended up in

One interesting phrase that was new to me is "Hacker Embassy".  I think                                                                                                       this nicely sums up one aspect of what we hope Noisebridge can be -- a                                                                                                        public face for hackers to the greater community, and also a focal point                                                                                                      for the Bay Area hacker community to interact with other hacker                                                                                                               communities around the world.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Bill Pollock gave a status update on the building.  He has hired an

As I understand it, Bill's priority is to get any structural work done

Note that no specific work has been decided upon (well, the toilet is                                                                                                         
pretty much a lock, I suspect); practicality, price, and timeframe all   
need to be evaluated.                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Bill expressed some concern over the idea of having a significant amount                                                                                                      
of "stuff" in the upstairs space, given that there is a good chance of

understand it is that "stuff" will impede progress on construction; it                                                                                                        
might be possible to mitigate this concern if Noisebridge members commit

The timeframe for this work, of course, depends on what work is being

structural work is decided upon, it won't be completed in less than
