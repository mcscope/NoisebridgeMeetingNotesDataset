== Consensus items ==
You may wish to '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to repeat '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on the consensus process]].

=== Proposals from last week ===

''(Add any items which pass or are blocked to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

=== Proposals for next week ===

''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

== Discussion Items ==

If an item of discussion drags on too long, further discussion may be postponed until after the meeting ends.

During discussion, it is not necessary to write down exact what each person says. Record the topics of discussion, and any items of consensus or controversy here. Detailed descriptions of the conversation should go on the discuss page for this meeting.

* Keypad

Jake sez "Made a keypad from a phone. There's an LED, arduino, and it's going to be bolted to the gate. There'll be a CAT5 cable that goes to minotaur serial port. It sends keypad tones, and it can send back happy or sad. Software was written so that you could type the right number. There's a key to lock it. It is a good but unexceptionable lock."

Jake has built this so that people can be more comfortable naked in the space.

Leif is not happy about the keypad idea, but have been
convinced to not argue about that. Keypads are shitty
security. And we should be pointing out shitty security
systems, not using them. Having a way to get in without
using the buzzer. More ways to get in the better. I'm okay
as long as all the mechanism is additive, and removing
other ones is not so good. If the keys stop working, I'll
rekey.

Kelly says noone has said anything about removing the physical keys.

Mark -- when I started coming here, I appreciated how I
could come here without stuff. Then I wondered about
people coming in and taking stuff. Noisebridge is looked
up by other hackerspaces, so your decisions counts. I love
the idea of the keypad, maybe as a complement to existing
systems. You should try it. It's hard to make judgements
about people who turn up. 

Augustine -- My question is: who you trying to keep out?
You can't keep out bad guys. It's futile to keep out
anyone out.  

Ronald -- I think the keypad is a good idea. We need more
creative ways of getting in. We definitely rekey locks
without landlord's permission. 

Jake -- we could rekey them again.

Kelly -- I want feebdack on unacceptable features of the
keycode generating system.

* Laser venting 

Leif says 'you're crazy'. Rayc says its better this way, and it doesn't smell.

Nick says it's not about the smell.

Augustine -- we don't know.

Jake -- we used to have lots of fumes, even when the
lasercutter was in the booth. We are a hackerspace, we
should work on the ventilation. Alan and Mike and
Christopher who have been working on making a cleanroom
for science, and they do extremely excellent things. We
should work with them.

Tom -- I should have the reasonable expectation that
people are doing excellent things. If you are claiming
that the plastic is safe, you should be able to explain
what the byproducts are, and test for them and show that
there aren't any. You should test.

Matt -- says "just say something when you're cutting"

Rob -- makerbots use plastic and could be using more
fumes. Corey said ducts need to be shorter. I think it's a good locatoin.

Miloh -- it's a negative pressure system now. That's kind
of the standard. 

Nick -- I was going to suggest a visible light.

Alan -- I think the lasercutter is in a good spot. It used
to be anti-social. I just cut the stinkiest plastic I
could, I sniffed around and couldn't smell it.

Rayc -- the improvements were put into place on Saturday.

Kelly -- can somebody provide 3rd party ventilation
standards.

* Membership expiration -- 

Kelly wanted to update people, and provide a brief forum
for discussion. We had a consensus item about membership
expiration, and hiatus expiration. We had some people
expire.

* DARPA  -- discuss it on the mailing list.

* Pets
