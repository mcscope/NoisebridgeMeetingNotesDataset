Weekly stuff (the usual, it's on the wiki)

Project updates:

Spacebridge launched Saturday from Dublin, it landed NE of Stockton, 80 mi, 2 hrs.  lots of pictures, 2 cameras on balloons but no video.  Success!

Bacchus, 60k ft, went nearly to Yosemite.  All of the retrievers but the driver got poison oak.  Success!

Library organized into loose categories (Programming by language, computer books, etc).  System for tracking books being planned, talk to Al to get involved.

Documentation! We have a tiny URL service at nburl.net, password is noiserat.  Write up stuff on the wiki, make a nburl for it, place a label on the item with the url so people can look it up.  Some things are labeled but not yet properly documented (write some docs if you know how things work!).  For example, the lathe has a nburl stuck on it.

* trash &amp; recycling bins organized, labeled, and set around
* plywood retaining strip in shop
* rear floor work begun, talk to Rachel to help
