= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* j- No empowerment. Everyone has equal rights. It shows commitment to the space and gives us rights to accept contributions: 40$(beginner) or 80$ a month. Grants 24 hour access to the space. 
Best way: hang out here, get to know people and you can become a member by filling forms and getting it signed by atleast by 2 members and no one objects.

* Mitch- Decision is made by concensus. People who are not members can have 24 hour access by becoming a philanthropist. As long as no members object. Ther is a form for that as well.


= [[Philanthropists]]=
None.

* Our rent went up!! We need more recurring donations.

= Consensus and Discussion =


What is consensus:
* To do big things: things that affect all in the community.
* consensus: all core members talk about issue and agree on it before it goes through. 
* Frowned upon to just say no without reason or solution.

* Anyone can join conversations, anyone can make objections with reasons however only members can make decisions. Proposal changes until everyone is happy enough or postpone consensus.

* Consensus is a long process so do-ocracy is followed. Do it if it will not bring any objections. Objectors can help do/undo the activity.

* Consensus is usually a 1 week process.
* No proposals right now.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==

None.

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==

== Discussion Items ==

* This Friday cyberdelia party. 8:00 pm on Friday watch hackers then go to 20th anniversary 

* Fundraiser for gaming archivists. In January. Help, objections contact Mari.

* J- security @ noisebridge. Doors are secured at all times. But during an event its an issue. Come up with a community solution to make space very accessible and secure, to assure safety of space and the people.

* Airplane grade carbon fiber fabric: who wants it? Mari will bring up for consensus.

=== fixing up noisebridge === 


Mitch: a year and a half ago we almost had to close noisebridge for ever because people who didn't belong here were here and were destroying the place.
Had to do a reboot. And now reboot is an annual thing
This year- noisebridge is doing a reboot right now. Can you contribute and grow from being a part of noisebridge?
Before reboot noisebridge was open 24 hours.

Cultural immune system: are new people a good cultural fit? Hang out here a while. Anyone can give a tour. Reinforces what you know. 

Someone can volunteer for an hour to be a greeter. So only the greeter knows of a new person and rest can focus on their work. 

If you come regularly, ask for an RFID pass.

Continuous discussion about what is excellent. If someone is not excellent, bring it up and ask for help. People who don’t belong here CAN'T stay. We want to keep noisebridge happy and healthy for all of us who do belong.

DON’T LET THE DOOR BE PROPPED OPEN. EVER.

When lots of new people come here for an event, have a class student let people in and have a tour for all interested people later.
