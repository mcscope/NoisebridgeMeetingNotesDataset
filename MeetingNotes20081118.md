== discussed projects ==
=== Digital Storms ===
A while ago I bought the domainname digitalstorms.com, i figured it would be nice to do some sort of project related to info maps, and i think one of the first maps, might be one that blends economic data with blogs.  [http://www.wefeelfine.org/ "we feel fine"] is a great project that blends art, with sensory computing, and allows the web to emote just a little bit about us.

=== voice stream ===
the idea here was to capture interesting data from a speech or conversation and somehow relate that to google searches and some sort of UI, either for art, fun, or profit.
