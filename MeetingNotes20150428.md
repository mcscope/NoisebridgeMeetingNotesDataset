* '''One or two bullet points of high-level meeting summary.'''

= Introductions =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to explain''' [[Noisebridge_Vision|what Noisebridge is about]]:
&lt;blockquote>Noisebridge is a 501c3 nonprofit that provides a space for creation, collaboration, and learning about technology and creative projects. Noisebridge provides space, power tools, and infrastructure to help the public learn new skills and create cool things. Noisebridge continues to exist through and depends entirely on membership fees and donations. Our code of conduct is 'Be excellent to each other'."&lt;/blockquote>
* Introduce any experimental or unusual moderation techniques that may be using during the meeting like: direct responses, limited speaking time, orderless stack, &amp;c.
* Round of introductions (remember, announcements come later):
** What's your name

= Short announcements and events =
* Cool new projects? Something you'd like people to know? Say now, but keep it short!
* Any happenings at the space of which members should be made aware.
* Don't hog everyone's time since we all just want to hack!

* Alex will be teaching game development class on Tuesdays after the Noisebridge meeting.
* http://pegasus/mute to quite the Noisebridge voice
* Mike form the Nametag project (giving away 25,000 nametags in San Fran: Castro, Delores Park, Ocean Beack, Hayes Valley, possibly the Marina, possibly somewhere in Oakland) seeks Noisebridge involvement - possibly including electronic "Hello" name tags in the event would be great. nametagday.com

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

* Alex - week 2

= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank: $31,337.00 (?)
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary): $11,000.00 (approximate)
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

We're above our 3 month buffer, but we're not yet cash-flow positive.
I'm hoping to get more recent figures together as to the composition of
our monthly income.
We are having a fundraising meeting next week.
Current proposals include:
* Having membership growth greeters during Maker Faire week.
* Throwing a Maker Faire afterparty as happened in previous years.
* Having greeters focused on growing membership at the Nametag Day tables.

= Consensus and Discussion =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

No pending consensus items

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

No new consensus items

== Discussion Items ==

If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

=== Maker Faire Membership Growth Party ===

WHEN:
* Maker Faire is on the 16th and 17th
* Party would be evening of 16th

TASKS
* Need to check for conflicting events on that night

VOLUNTEERS
* [[User:Lxpk|Alex Peake]] alex@primerlabs.com User:lxpk
* Alex ____

ADVISORS
People with party organizing experience to talk to about organizing a membership growth party:
* [[User:Rubin110|Rubin]]
* [[User:Nthmost|Naomi]]
* [[user:James|James]]

=== Nametag Day ===

[[User:Lxpk|Alex Peake]] is helping Noisebridge organize an electronic nametag making station at the Nametag Day Delores Park Station.

Nametag -- 12,000 distributed in NYC last two years. 

Governance -- a few people running it and a bunch of 'nametag day fanatics'

exists in four cities this year. goal to have it all over the planet and get people talking together.

Confusion with conferences?

Happens on the weekend, in parks.

=== Posters at Noisebridge work stations ===

Will be iconic and beginner friendly. [[User:Lxpk|Alex]] will put them up and if someone doesn't like them they can take them down.

=== Opening the space with the sun ===

Will not depend on goverenment time (Ex PDT), strictly sunrise. Call a webservice to get the daily sunrise time.

The space opens when someone is here to open it.

Clarification - the RFID cards should function to open the doors at sunrise.

Currently three types of keys:
&lt;br>0 - anon, expires 30 days, access 11:00-22:00
&lt;br>1 - not anon, does not expire, access 11:00-22:00
&lt;br>2 - not anon, does not expire, access 24hr, can enter new anon keys into DB

By policy, the space is as open as possible and members should have 24hr access. Open hours help to maintain safety.

DISCUSSION

* Many normal hours users need to get in earlier in the morning and would come more often to hack all day.
* Jade: Access control was by [[Do-ocracy]] and wasn't made by consensus.
* [[User:Tdfischer|Torrie]]: A subset of people agreed on access control.
* Suggestion: Should we send regular emails to mailing list members to poll people on how they feel about major discussion topics to ensure more people feel included in the informal consensus building process?
* [[User:Danf|Dan]]: We need more people in the space, earlier hours are good.

= End of Meeting =

* Reprise of the [[Hackernationale]]. [This is anarchy - we do what the wiki says!]
* [[PGP|PGP Key Signing]] could happen now (if it doesn't happen '''before''' any given Meeting).  Ask others around the space or check the [[PGP|list]] to see who wants in on the action.
* Return the [[membership binder]] to its rightful location.
* Clean and tidy the meeting notes including removing all these really verbose instructions, then save them to the wiki.
* Send a summary of the meeting notes to the discussion list.
* Enjoy the company of your fellow hacker, robot, or robothacker.
* Discuss any items for which there was not time during the meeting.
