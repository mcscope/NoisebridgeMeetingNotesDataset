 #2 edit the meeting notes date to reflect the date of the meeting
 #3 edit the meeting number to reflect the nth meeting of Noisebridge 
 #4 (wish all this was programmatic!)
 #5 this page often 'dead-ends' and is consequently difficult to navigate usefully.  Add and update links in the meeting notes template as necessary to make the notes more dynamic and useful for all

=== Announcements ===


What's going on at Noisebridge. Go look at the wiki. We have 5 minutes of fame, we did lots of Maker Faire things, vegan hacking coming up, SF chapter of the Open organization of lock pickers who will do their event as soon as they can break in. BioBridge, Django, etc. Danny explains [[BioBridge]] which is an Arduino thing set up to sense things about the [[Kombucha brewing log|kombucha]]. They measure turbidity, temperature, ph, and so on. They got a [[Maker Faire 2011]] editor's choice award.  Hey, cool, the brewing project spawned an electronics project.  [[Second Saturday]] is coming up in 3 weeks for June and is for infrastructure hacking.  We are a do-ocracy etc etc.   New guy Ryan asks who to talk with because his company is just donating some servers. Kelly says to email the rack list (https://www.noisebridge.net/mailman/listinfo) and ask.

Crutcher is putting together a group on meta-heuristic optimization.  He has been putting a lot of time into it lately and wants to know if anyone else is interested.



=== Financial Report ===
Funds in bank: 16,913.79. Rent has not gone through yet, so subtract rent from that.  There is also another transfer about to go through.  Tshirt money from Maker Faire has not come in yet.   

Our taxes.  Which were late.  We forgot to file an extension.  Our tax guy, we have issues with him. He did our taxes last year and they were screwed up.  He had to redo them and claimed his assistant did them wrong. OUr treasurer caught the errors.  He said he would do our taxes for free this year in exchange.  Maybe that wasn't such a good idea.   We should have hired someone else.   He told us the late fee was $20 a month but the IRS tells us it is $20 per business day , since the 16th.   We sent him our information on the 19th and we haven't heard back from him and then finally this morning heard from him.  He can't get to our stuff for another week or so. ($20 a day).  What do people think we should do at this point?

We don't pay any taxes, we just file a 990N.   But it is complex enough to need someone professional to do it for us.  How did we find this guy?  He's a hipster accountant. T*x N*nja. Feedback from people at the meeting: Why would we ever trust this guy again? 

What other non profits might talk with us about what they do or rec us a tax person? Hackerdojo? Walk SF?  Box Shop?  


=== Membership Binder ===
Ryan Salisbury is now been read for 4 weeks and is up for membership
Eric Steinberg 
Ryan wants to be a member because the space looks interesting and could be useful to him, tools are awesome, and he wants to support the space and the work it does. Crutcher who is wearing a red shirt that says BLOCK asks if he likes arguments that go on and on and on and on. Ryan says, give him an example of an argument. And that some are good for the mailing list, like bedbugs, which he has seen no evidence of. Kelly grills Ryan on his feelings about consensus decision making. Ryan mentions radical bike activism and thinks consensus okay but would tend to drop out of exhausting long arguments rather than blocking for reasons he doesn't feel very strongly about it. Alex says he has good insight into plasma treating polyurethane or something. Woo!  Gosh we are asking Ryan quite a lot of questions.  Ryan contributed to iChat's videoconferencing framework and various other software projects.  People are asking Ryan quite a lot of questions. We devolve into general Apple dev gossip. Apparently he brought several 6 packs already. He goes off to Safeway for a while.

Ryan is discussed briefly and is now a member.

=== Consensus items ===

(Danny O'B up for secretary)

''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current_Consensus_Items|Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

=== Discussion Items ===

Danny recuses himself from being the moderator for the meeting since he is the subject of it. Item, that Noisebridge make Danny O'Brien secretary. This was discussed last week. Some people expressed uneasiness that Danny has TOO MUCH POWER. 

Crutcher, who is wearing a hilarious bright red tshirt that says BLOCK on it, remarks that Danny looks rather shifty.

What does the secretary do?  They interface with companies for us. They see to it that notes are taken at meetings. They negotiate with insurance so Kelly doesn't have to, and track the membership stuff.  Stuff that is necessary which isn't actually bookkeeping. Kelly just wants a helper to do a bunch of work, basically, and Danny has agreed to do it.

No one blocks.  

Danny adds in that SETH HAS BEEN VERY AWESOME as secretary.
