If an item of discussion drags on too long, further discussion may be postponed until after the meeting ends.

* Hosting [http://www.kinkforall.org KinkForAll] (un-conference about relationships) at Noisebridge on Sat. June 30th. (Alisa)
** Approximately 20 minute talks centered on sexuality, sexual health, and human interactions
** Intentionally no demos so as to be all ages
** Boring logistics: intends to use both classrooms, 9am-5pm, with about 40 attendees
** An attempt to bridge the hacker and alt-sex communities, thus the desire to host at NB.
** MCT is sponsoring
**[later] The date has since been changed to June 16th to avoid conflicts with SF Pride related events.

* Kitchen
** Can we disallow storing all personal food from the kitchen?
*** Pros:
**** Discourage habitation
**** Discourage GROSS NASTY ROTTEN FOOD (empirically, this happens)
*** Cons:
**** People do legitimately store personal food in the kitchen

** Discussion:
*** ????:  Consensus or not, this should be formally decided
*** Tom
**** People have been keeping food here since the space first existed. 
**** Documenting fridge policy is important for people who depend on Noisebridge for their ability to avoid hunger
**** Once people start taking food, one won't be able to  feel safe about preparing food for yourself and others
*** Cynthia
**** Can we expand the scope to all food storage places? Murmurs: yes
*** Leif
**** This is a place where we shouldn't have explicit rules since rules lead to arbitrary enforcement, and arbitrary enforcement leads to confusion
**** We don't have enough space at NB for permanent personal food storage for everyone
**** This has worked informally well for a while
**** People should expect the loss of their food if they keep it at noisebridge
*** SuperQ
**** The consensus process of noisebridge is for the membership
**** Leif++. Everything at noisebridge outside of the member shelves is up for hacking, but don't be a dick.
**** Don't take food that's obviously for cooking for the day
*** Kelly
**** I'd like to mention that I'm really ticked off by the idea the people feel entitled to keep food here more than a few hours before a specific cooking project
**** Just because we don't choose to consense on a specific standard of behavior on the space doesn't mean we don't have an expected standard of excellence
**** If you are keeping food in the fridge for a project and it is eaten, that is un excellent and deserving of mediation
**** It is not excellent to keep personal supplies at noisebridge
**** Tom: Do you think it's okay to take 
*** Question: What is food in the fridge? Answer: everything!
*** Rayc:
**** When I started coming to NB, the fridge was full of declicious tastebridge Kombucha
**** It sucks that we don't have that
**** I think the fair game policy is correct, especially given the large amount of grocery stores
*** Jumana
**** Maybe it would be good to have people write their name and date
**** Communication is good!
**** Kelly: If you have labelled something for a specific purpose, you are excellence
*** Duncan: 
**** I agree with Leif &amp; Kelly:  Label and don't be a dick.  I've kept labelled "No Shr Pls" eggs &amp; milk here to hack chocolate chip cookies.  
**** Discovering no eggs at 10pm after buying a dozen @noon is frustrating.  The kitchen is here for hacking food &amp; sharing results, NOT to feed the world.
**** Not respecting "no share/pls ask first" &amp; hogging limited is most unexcellent.  Some areas, like the counter, are community. 
**** Food is expensive for many, scarce for all when stores are closed.  This idea of "open sourcing" to everybody the perishable 
**** inputs for kitchen hacking feels like a poorly thought-through social engineering to an unstated bigger issue.  
**** Do we REALLY want NB to become known as that "place in the Mission to get free food to cook and eat"?
**** Food is a basic necessity and for many at all incomes, a very personal emotional thing. What's the REAL issue here?
**** Bags on the day-shelf are left unhacked, why should marked food be different?
*** Tom: I don't think NB is a place for medium-term food storage
*** Snail
**** We can't guarantee safety of the day-shelves; we don't like people keeping their goods there for extended periods of time.
*** Kelly: While it is possible to use NB excellently for your day to day necessities, NB is not for support
*** Tom
**** Food in the fridge for an hour has been yoinked
**** That is unexcellent, and has lead to conflict
*** Kelly:
**** There has never been a policy on the fridge one way or the other
**** The signs previously existing were do-ocratic and can be changed
*** There are murmurs that the purviews of Excellence can keep this under control
*** Q: What happens when Tastebridge wants to make more Kombucha
**** A: Kombucha is awesome
*** Kelly:
**** We may have at one time consensed on the idea that everything at NB is up for hacking except for the membership shelves. 
**** Does anyone remember?
**** MCT: Agreed, and it is the informal consensus of NB that that is the case




** Kitchen electrical use
*** SuperQ wants to un-open the kitchen.
*** In order to do some experiments, the electrical hookup to the kitchen will be disabled
*** This is mostly the Stove, Oven, and Dishwasher, but NOT the fridges and hot water
*** We have no direct ability to measure the kitchen's energy uses
*** We can compare the no-kitchen week with the previous week(s) to find out
*** Interested people should check the Electricity Wiki
*** Kelly: Poke tastebridge@
*** SuperQ: I will conclude this before tastebridge next meets
