Crutcher notes that Burning man is close.

Is there anything new happening at the space?
Is there anything that has stopped happening at the space?

=== Membership Binder ===
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Write a check on every open application.
* Anyone up for joining this week (ie have four checks by their name + have two sponsors) should introduce themselves then leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime) for the rest of the group. The rest of the meeting should consense on whether they may join.

=== Consensus items ===

''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current_Consensus_Items|Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

=== Discussion Items ===

The last projector has failed. The main area's installed projector is fine, but there's no projector for classes in Turing and Church. Buy a new one?

Discussed the membership lapsing issue.

Crutcher says that the issue is we need a consistent way to let members lapse that doesn't let people turn up from a million years ago, pay $40 and magically block. 

Mike -- suggested a maintenance fee, pay a little amount to tick over. Will and Crutcher felt that would be to too much overhead.

We agreed to work on text to make a consensus proposal for next week (to be condensed on next week).
