=== Introduction and Names ===

Please set your phones to silent, Steve Jobs is about to take the stage.

=== What Noisebridge [[Noisebridge_Vision|is about]] ===
=== Treasurer's Report ===

We have about $18,500.
We have 80 members no more than 3 mos. late on dues
Of these 36 members are late on dues, 12 members are more than 1 mo. late.
(So 44 members are current on dues.)

The number of Noisebridge members has decreased due to people leaving and
due to clerical error.

Skipped.

''One '''short''' sentence about each of the following:''

=====Weekly=====

* [[PythonMondays | Python Mondays]] (6:30 PM, 2169) - hope Dan feels better

* Shop Friday still plans to come back when the shop is done.

NEW EVENT: Thursdayish -- a '''3D model''' of the space is being
put together and will be publicly announced soon.  This will involve
more volunteers to help map out the space in 3D so that the model
will be available for various purposes, including visualization and
planning.

Q. Can we combine the security and 3D model activities?
Q. For example can we make a model of Noisebridge and then try to break
into the model?
A. No.

NEW EVENT: [[Spacebridge]] group met on Sunday.  This was attended by 12 people,
including people with various connections to the aerospace industry.
They are interested in putting things into space, using high-altitude
balloons.  This group will be meeting regularly to discuss balloon
launches starting in the new year.

=====One-time=====
* First Aid/CPR class - Christie knows about this.

=== Project Updates ===

* [[Noisecloud]] - Geek.net gave us lots of computers (this is the new name
of VA Software!) -- roughly 300 machines, 50 are currently operational
right now in Redwood City.  Dr. Jesus copied public keys from pony.  We will
use these machines to provide useful services and satisfy things that other
nonprofits have had trouble with; for example, we can provide build hosts
to FreeBSD or other projects that need build hosts.

Colocation and other related services are also being donated by another
entity.  Thanks!

Q. How do we log in to these?
A. You can talk to Dr. Jesus for access.  There are 111 cores in
45 available machines up and running right now, with quite substantial
memory, processing, and storage capacity.

* South stairwell fire escape

A few weeks ago there was a small fire in the south stairwell.  Dr. Jesus
talked to the landlords about this: the south stairwell should be used only
in case of emergency.  It cannot be used for non-emergency purposes.  There
will be a security system that will alarm on use or monitor use of the
stairwell.  Other discussions are in progress with the first floor tenant
to ensure that the exit will be clear and that it will remain usable as
an exit.  This work is not yet complete, but it's underway.

====2169 Mission====
* Electrical
* Library
* Kitchen
* Network
* Heat

Andy bought some plastic film that prevents heat from escaping as readily
through the skylights, particularly the skylights with vents.  There is
more film available and some ladders if people want to put up more of
this.
