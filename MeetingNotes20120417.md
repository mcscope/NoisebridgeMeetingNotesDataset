Robert and Hype are doing a bunch of work in the
dirty shop. Any help is appreciated.

Nick is moving Lua to kernelmode. 

Kelly says that the new gate costs $60, Jesse is

===archive.org aka the Internet Archive HDD enclosure donation===

Noisebridge is potentially recieving a donation of usb 3.0 hdd enclosures, new in the box, from [http://archive.org| archive.org]

I'll be storing these HDD enclosures on top of the dark room and the hackershelves area.  They will be available for a donation TBD (probably under $5 for a usb 3.0 SATA 3.5 inch enclosure with 12vdc swpsu and 12-5 usb3.0 supply!), the total donations recieved will be split equally between the 501c3's noisebridge.org and archive.org.

== Consensus items ==
You may wish to '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to repeat '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on the consensus process]].

=== Proposals from last week ===

''(Add any items which pass or are blocked to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

=== Proposals for next week ===

''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

== Discussion Items ==

We took the temperature of Noisebridge.  People
felt things were stable and pretty good these
days, but the communities was a bit scattered
and didn't always know all the cool things that
go on --- people don't use nb-discuss to share
stuff any more.

Suggestions: a big party, a new mailing list,
noisebridge university (which Jesse and Jake are
working on), actually use the blog, a primary
reduction party.

Kelly agrees to set up noisebridgefuckyeah.tumblr.com

== End of Meeting ==
* [[PGP|PGP Key Signing]] could happen now, check the [[PGP|list]] to see who wants in on the action.
* Return the [[membership binder]] to it's rightful location.
* Clean and tidy the meeting notes, then save them to the wiki.
* Send a summary of the meeting notes to the discussion list.
* Enjoy the company of your fellow hacker or robot.
* Discuss any items for which there was not time during the meeting.
