* [[User:Saizai|Sai]] (Week 3) - 1 sponsor ([[User:Malaclyps|Danny]])

= Financial Report =
* [[User:Malaclyps|Danny]] wrote a Python script to go through Mint.com and parse all of our transactions into a spreadsheet and sum total

= Consensus items =

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
* [[User:Flamsmark|Tom]]: "We add a new plain HTML front page to the Noisebridge domain, to allow for a design more amenable to newcomers. The system for managing this content should have the property that a small number can push changes live, while many folks can produce designs and stage/suggest them."
** Decision to discuss &amp; postpone consensus decision because [[User:Flamsmark|Tom]] is not present and, in contrast to last week, most people present are pro-MediaWiki
** [[User:Malaclyps|Danny]] has friends over at MediaWiki, so if there are things we need or don't like we should get in touch
** [[User:SuperQ|Ben]] has friends who may be able to rewrite MediaWiki in not-PHP
** Many present agree that their favorite language is not-PHP
** '''Images for MediaWiki should be SMALLER! ([[User:Kenhaggerty|Ken]] is dumb) since we pay to host large files!'''
** [[User:SuperQ|Ben]]: [[User:Dr_jesus|Dr. Jesus]] needs to stop pinging Noisebridge; claims 80% (90%?) of all visits to Noisebridge.net are from [[User:Dr_jesus|Dr. Jesus]] pinging us
** Proposed alternatives for image hosting:

*** [http://www.flickr.com/groups/noisebridge Flickr Noisebridge group]
* Ken will make a wiki page to coordinate the Wiki redesign

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
* [[User:Leif|Leif]] is writing one new consensus proposal regarding creating a new account at SFFireCU.

= Discussion Notes =
== Hell's Cargo (i.e., Wells Fargo) ==
* Kevin: Currently Noisebridge's bank account is Hell's Cargo, which is an evil bank. Let's switch to something less evil, like a local credit union. Maybe [http://www.sffirecu.org San Francisco Fire Credit Union]? They have an education business account(?) and pay 2.5% interest and invest locally.
** Why do we have Hell's Cargo…? Apparently last time Noisebridge proposed a switch away we didn't because it's just a bit of a pain, and a few people had direct deposits set up into our account.
** [[User:Malaclyps|Danny]]: People have pledged to donate so long as we switch from PayPal
** [[User:SuperQ|Ben]]: SFFireCU has terrible IT but great customer service, while most banks have decent IT but terrible customer service...so while their tech is bad, at least they will fix it?
** Additional credit union suggestions: Self-Pay ([[User:Malaclyps|Danny]]), Redwood Credit Union (Dan #2)
* General consensus seems to be in favor of at least creating a new account with SFFireCU and keeping the Hell's Cargo account until it is obsolete.
* Someone ([[User:Malaclyps|Danny]]? [[User:Leif|Leif]]?) will write a consensus proposal for next week's meeting
