* '''Noisebridge is a HACKER SPACESHIP, a community-based environment where you do what you want as long as the community is "pretty OK" with it. We use do-ocracy. (And, more rarely, consensus.) As a community you have the opportunity to engage, do your part to sustain the environment and/or change it to make it better.  Noisebridge is also for anything that's DIY! and Art!''' [[Noisebridge_Vision|what Noisebridge is about]]: 
&lt;blockquote>Noisebridge is a 501c3 nonprofit that provides a space for creation, collaboration, and learning about technology and creative projects. Noisebridge provides space, power tools, and infrastructure to help the public learn new skills and create cool things. Noisebridge continues to exist through and depends entirely on membership fees and donations. Our code of conduct is 'Be excellent to each other'."&lt;/blockquote>

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* [[membership]] and the application process:
* Membership has morphed over the years, but we're still, above all, an anarchist space.  So if someone walks in and asks "who's in charge here?!" we all laugh! 
* We have several levels of belongingness that demonstrate commitment to the space. Capital-M Membership is a process of ratifying that you're part of community, we've gotten to know you, you know the ins and outs of the space, doocracy, what consensus is and how it functions, and we have a level of mutual trust in your ability to be a steward of the space, both physically and community-wise.
* We also have a philanthropist level which is almost the same as membership in terms of belonging and contributing and taking responsibility for the space.
* Philanthropy level is easier to attain: It takes 1 member to ratify your philanthropist application as your sponsor. It is easy to cancel a philanthropy member by design because the process is short.
* By comparison, membership is more slow because membership is harder to undo and full participation in Consensus is the privilege of Membership! (You have the ability to block a consensus item if you feel it compromises Noisebridge values.) We haven't had to use consensus very often lately which is good.
* To become a Member, we require 4 weeks of you having application in the membership binder with sponsorship signatures of 2 other full members. We read your name aloud at meetings (though you don't need to be present each meeting). Ideally, to successfully become a Member, your name should be at least fairly well known, i.e. you don't want the whole room going, "who TF is that?"
* After 4 weeks, you attend the meeting and we discuss your membership, and you leave the room while we decide, and if we consense you become a full M Member.
* We have 28 or 30 philanthropists!
* Important point: You don't need to be a Member or Philanthropist to participate, teach a class, or donate money! 

&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>

* No applicants!

= [[Philanthropists]]=
* '''A new-ish organizational construct that helps us extend the community, keep the space open, and move towards positive cash flow.''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* To become philanthropist, 1 sponsor vouches and you commit to donate a monthly amount to the space. It is $80 or starving hacker rate $40.

= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank: ???
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary): ???
* We should probably hold a fundraiser for the imminently arriving laser cutter.


= Consensus and Discussion =

* '''Consensus?! we don't need no steenking consensus'''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]

* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''


“Consensus: “The process of abandoning all beliefs, principles, values, and policies in search of something in which no one believes, but to which no one objects; the process of avoiding the very issues that have to be solved, merely because you cannot get agreement on the way ahead. What great cause would have been fought and won under the banner: ‘I stand for consensus?” --Margaret Thatcher


== Discussion Items ==

=== The Mysterious Case of the Cordless Dremel ===

* Zach: I'd like to contribute a Dremel. Would like to have a simple deterrent to theft for the dremel.
* Alex: A locker perhaps?
* Naomi: did you say it needs a battery?
* Zach: a 12v lithium ion one -- ~$25 or so. I have a charger and bits and everything else.  Donate towards some good metal cutting bits, if anyone wants.

=== The Evil Antics of the Elevator ===

* Zach: e.g. if you hold the button for too long, it goes an inch and a half too low, causing problems for people in chairs, etc.
* Alex: maybe we could make a sign? post this to the nb-discuss list?
* Scotty: I think Rubin's been the main pt of contact with the landlord. He's out of the country right now though.

=== TODO-ocracy ===
```Every other Thursday at 7pm, people meet to manage Noisebridge tickets and do boring shit that keeps the space running.```

* Brian: The doorbell in front of the elevator isn't working.
* Jim: let's talk about SparkleForge
* Jared: Volunteers to help with electrical, contact hicksu@gmail.com
