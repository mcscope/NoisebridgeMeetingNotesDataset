= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

* Sam Tepper, two sponsors, week 7

= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank: $18,915.90
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary): ~$10,000
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

= Consensus and Discussion =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

nil

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

=== Streamlining meetings by breezing through membership binder ===

A proposal to not read out the description from the membership binder after 4 weeks

Hearing said description doesn't stick

Doesn't need to be a consensus item, could be a cultural practice

Does the formal process of paper reading have any benefit at all?

With membership specifically, it's great to describe who somebody is and encourage others to meet them.

I like our process because it gives us the opportunity to survey the room for an impression of the impact of the person. The description provides context beyond the name.

One problem is that person is almost never at the meeting.

We could add space to describe why applicants hang out at the space to the sheet.. class, shop, meetup, etc... 

Kind of in the description, could be more explicit on the membership form.

Could ask applicants to attend 4 Tuesday meetings

Not all potential members can attend Tuesday meetings

Even if folks cannot attend meetings, they should be around, active in the community

Encourage people contribute to the space sin membership

We could have a noisebridge wishlist on the kiosk

=== Sticker factory ===

A proposal to have a sticker-making machine at Noisebridge

== Discussion Items ==

If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

=== Financial Reimbursements ===

==== Stickers ====

Mitch ordered $1,200 worth of stickers @ $0.19/sticker and should be reimbursed from the tresurey

==== Laser tube ====

* Mitch purchased a laser tube for the laser cutter, looking to be reimbursed
** Shannon has the laser cutter, we should try again to contact him and bring the LC back to Noisebridge
*** Scotty can pick it up with a vehicle this week

=== Jukie and Surger machines ===

Maria would like to get some sewing going at Noisebridge. Teaching classes, threading the machines, maintaining the machines. Knitting knowledge will help to understand how the machines operate.

What are the key points needed to get the sewing area up to speed:

* Mechanic to look at the machines
* An orientation to the machines
* Apply new straight needle to the surger
* Teach the types of fabric that the machines can handle (thick materials will offset timings on the machine)
* Improved signage
** Ex: If you don't know how it works, you will probably damage the equipment
** Ex: This is a special use, sensitive instrument. If you do not know how to thread it, please do not.
* Folks have been reimbursed to fix the surger 
* Jukie needs some love
* More classes would be great
* Great documentation on the wiki. Disconnect between wiki and space. Needs organization. All signs are gone. Needles and bobbins are all over the place.

=== Indiegogo lighup shirts ===

J has priced out the shirts. Need to order at least 5-10 shirts per size to hit the optimal price. Need someone to place the order. Should order more shirts(10) around the mean size of shirt worn and fewer (5) smalls and extra large. (~60 total shirts)

Because it's a new vendor to us, we should ask for one proof first.

=== LED Strips ===

Torrie is working on LED strip sky lighting, the strips have arrive

=== RFID Reader ===

Running on the upstairs door, has a stronger reader to work on weak signal emitters.

We have key fobs available for $5.00 suggested donation. Clipper cards also work. Our system currently has the capability to add new users to the system from the key reader. New users are anon and expire after 30 days. To make new users permanent, we need to edit a file adding some contact information. Giving someone the permission to add new users requires editing a file atm.

Please see [https://github.com/hzeller/rfid-access-control Henner's git repository] for the RFID project specifications.
