K

* Cool new projects? Something you'd like people to know? Say now, but keep it short! One or two sentences please!
* Any happenings at the space of which members should be made aware.
* Don't hog everyone's time since we all just want to hack!

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =
* MITCH: You don't need membership to do almost anything here but you can be one if you love NB and want to support on ongoing basis. What membership gives you that you don't get otherwise is automatic 24 hour access tokens and the other is full involvement in our consensus process.
* To be a member is a simple process that takes some doing. Since decisions are made with consensus, we want people involved to be cool by the community. Take one of the handy forms and put your name in, why you want to be a member, then submit it and hang out 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, if you've got 2 signatures signing from members vouching you show up and if nobody objects you become a member.
* It is not the same as membership at a gym. Membership is stewardship to build and protect NB space. As such, it is important part of NB overall. If stewardship isn't something you're ready for but you want 24 hour access and want to contribute, you can become a philanthropist with just 1 member to vouch for you.

* Applicants this month:
* J (other J): j@jphosting.net 4th week. 
* Chris: 3rd week. Torrie and Alex.
* Valentine: 1st week. Alex sponsors.

* Philanthropy 

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

= [[Philanthropists]]=
* MITCH: One of the things that keeps our community healthy is stewardship. The community wants to attract people who are good for the space. Not everyone is welcome if they don't follow our one rule, be excellent to each other. If someone doesn't follow that, they'll be asked to change, if they're not willing they're asked to leave. Members and philanthropists are both stewards for making our cultural immune system is working well. We work collectively to attract good people and repel people who aren't. People who belong here are people who contribute to the community and people who benefit from our community.

* Blocking is a last resort thing and in a healthy process and in a good case if someone is objecting then discussion can go on. Blocking is only necessary if someone feels that they wouldn't want to be a member if the proposal went on.

* JAMES: Your actions are what matter in the space and being involved and learning and helping others learn is do-ocracy. That's why the space continues to exist and things happen. If you want to have 24 hour acces and be involved, you can become a philanthropist.

* J: It's like friendship you take time to get to know someone and put the time in to build commitment over time by getting to know members of the community. It's not just waiting 4 weeks time, it comes with spending those weeks getting to know people. Member applicant spends time showing they want to be a part.

* Ronald "Milo": No objections. Milo is a philanthropist.

* '''Invite a knowledgeable member to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

* You can also help the space by coming in to clean up, helping teach a class. Many teachers would love to have assistant teachers to share the teaching.

= Consensus and Discussion =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

== Discussion Items ==
