  Several new faces. Some excerpts follow:

  Seth is here to look for smoke detectors. 
  Tim is here because this place is rad.
  Aestetix is here to cause drama.
  Jesse is curious about what this place is about.
  Andy occasionally makes robots or pretends to.
  James is here to apply for 15 minutes of fame.
  Gian Pablo is not into drama.
  Mike does whatever type of fill-in type, little ques... [Andy stops him]
  Andreas is visiting from Germany.
  Chris is checking what this place is all about. Steve asked him to come.
  Meredith is a cartoonist and that's pretty much it.
  Rachel is managing the board manager election process.
  Michael is here for two more weeks.
  Dave isn't sure why he's here.
  Steve would be a member if he paid dues.
  Shannon sits quietly and keeps to himself.
  Jim brought stuffing. He likes the library.
  Jeff was a member of the Tokyo hacker space.
  Mudslider thinks he might be banned from here.


20:18 - What Noisebridge is about.

  Jeffrey tells us what it's about.


20:19 - Treasurer's report.

  Jeffrey tells us we have $14.5K left. We paid for the Club Mate.


20:22 - Andy brings us a last minute bonus item!

  Google has a matching funds donation thingy for Noisebridge; Andy is working
  on getting us the money (of which there is something like $3000) but must
  write more emails to do so.


20:23 - Primer on the consensus process.

  Jeffrey tells us what that is. Aestetix, Jim, Andy and Rachel all say
  varying things. Someone says something about Communism.


20:25 - What's going on at Noisebridge?

  Shannon moves that we just go through the items and not have a sentence
  about them. Jeffrey concurs. Progress is brisk till we realize that the
  Linux thing has been omitted; Jim calls attention to this and Andy adds it.
  Shannon mentions that there is a knot workshop on Sundays.


20:28 - Board elections with Rachel!

  Rachel reads off the board nominees and describes the process to us. There
  is an absentee ('virtual') voting process as well as an election on the 8th
  of December.


20:33 - Build out updates with Jim!

  Jim talks about various things; did not catch that.

  Steve tells us the library is still in process. Jim found some shelves in
  Mill Valley that are real, real cheap.

  Jeffrey tells us that the kitchen has tile and a stove (not installed). We
  are looking for a double oven.


20:35 - Network status with Andy!

  MonkeyBrains donated a link last week. Due to some discussion on the mailing
  list, MonkeyBrains changed our connection but Andy has not fully assessed
  the consequences of this change.


20:36 - Dark room with Kelly!

  It's not dark yet but there's been progress. Coming items include painting,
  dreaming about a sink, caulking before painting, a door.


20:38 - Consensus items.

  None whatsoever.


20:38 - Membership binder.

  Alex Handy gets up to get the binder. Meanwhile, Seth asks if we got any new
  members last week. We did, Xander. Alex Handy returns.


20:43 - Microscope with Mike Kahn!

  Mike Kahn has a scanning electron microscope he would like consider donating
  to us. Andy wants to know how big it is? It's a big as a bookshelf. We have
  a show of hands to see who's interested. Five to six people raise their
  hands.

  The device is a complete scanning electron microscope. It does not require
  any vacuum or cooling or whatever. It only requires electricity.

  Andy asks two more questions. Is the device noisy? No. Does it require
  dangerous materials, such as radioactive materials? No.

  Someone -- not sure who -- asks what, if any, consumables there are. There
  are consumables -- filaments.

  Alex Handy thinks "we should just bring it here". Others concur.


20:50 - FMOF and James.

  James would like to talk at Five Minuts of Fame; he is referred to Aestetix.
  Aestetix talks about Five Minutes of Fame. We would like a clicky thing to
  count attendees.


20:51 - Meeting is done.
