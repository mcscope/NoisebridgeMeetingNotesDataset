=== Financial Report ===
*Note: Changes name of section from "Treasurer's Report," as it's often not given by the treasurer.

Funds in bank: $12457.68

Pending liabilities:
*$3600 - Rent (just sent the check)
*$1500 - Reimbursement for buildout electrical expenses

Adjusted for liabilities, our current liquid assets are approximately $7357.

Recent non-recurring expenses:
*$787.96 - 4,000 stickers (that's about 20 cents a sticker!)
*$442.29 - 50 t-shirts

Our PG&amp;E bill has also increased by 61% between our May ($284) and June ($457) bills.  This is primarily due to a sizable rate increase, and will continue this way throughout the summer.

=== Project Updates ===

=== Consensus items ===

Membership Induction
People up for membership:  Hephestus and Dan Farina 
It is discussed and consensed that they shall be members of noisebridge and sally forth, huzzah.

=== Discussion Items ===

* Consensus Item:  Payment freeze is discussed.  There is contention that noisebridge doesn't need a freeze because there are no current costs and the buildout fund is exhausted for after the above build out costs are covered.  Attempts to bring up funding for the remaining build out are a non-starter.


* Proposed consensus item: 
Spending freeze for all non-recurring items.  This would halt any already approved expenses for build out, advertising (eg, stickers) or similar.  It would not affect existing recurring expenses, such as rent, power, internet, insurance, etc.

* Floor
The floor in the back space is still in the process of finishing.

* Fire escape
Please keep the area in the west near the hack shelves clear of hack shelf debris
This is a vital fire escape area.

* Spectrum analyzer
There's a new Spectrum analyzer at noisebridge.  Please don't load the input space with more than (20?)mA (fix this amount)
