= Financial Report =

The reboot did cost a lot of Money. 5 tons of e-waste went missing. Walls were demolished, floor was addedâ€¦

* Funds in bank: 24k;
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary): 9k+ from the above 24k;
* We spend between 3 and 4k every month;
* Matching donation fundraiser: 10/11k right now, Rubin and Patrick have a list of people to reach out to get more donators to commit to donate and will work on it soonish.

Consensus: we need moar money, keep in mind that we are only running on donations.

You don't have to be a member to donate.

Concerns about higher rent: to make things clear, there is no plan to move in another place. The lease is ending this year in the summer or fall and yes we need to start thinking about how we are going to negotiate the new lease given the state of this building and the market state.

= Consensus and Discussion =

Board election process consensus passed last week. Nothing postponed from last week.

== Discussion Items ==

If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

Closing the space:

* Kevin: It felt uncomfortable, I don't wanna do it again. The people who where here felt more trustable than me (the only member in this space) at this particular moment;
* Steve &amp; Louis: we think that the access control we have in place is one of the success of this reboot;
* Dan: I sympathize with Kevin's feelings, but giving the space hours helps bringing-in balance to it;
* Mohammed: tell the people that get kicked out in the evening or who are stuck in the mornings to come at the meeting. Scheduling members who open and close the space is interesting because it makes you identify regulars;
* Louis: I really like the concept of balance, I think closing and opening hours bring balance to the space; I also really like Mohammed idea of a schedule of people to open or close the space.
