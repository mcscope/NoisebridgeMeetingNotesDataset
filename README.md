# NoisebridgeMeetingNotesDataset
This is a dataset of almost 10 years of noisebridge meeting notes. It was created by me in May 2017 as part of Noisebridges 'stupid shit' hackathon. 
I trained a neural network off of this data. 
I am publishing the dataset so that others can use it without going through the steps I took to clean and sanitize the data.

All the notes are in markdown format, in a variety of styles depending on who took the notes.
Some are quite a good read.
