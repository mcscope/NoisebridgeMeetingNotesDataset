* Workshops
** Processing is tentatively 2pm, 9/13 (subject to Rachel confirming)
** We looked at different Processing demos on OpenProcessing.org
** Mitch will schedule the soldering workshop when he gets back 
** We will plan to record the Processing workshop; volunteers for recording TBD. 
* Spaces
** Andy discussed the EFF space. 
*** Roughly 800-900 square feet
*** Roughly class B space (market rate ~$1-$1.50/month)
*** No separate entry; we go through same lobby as EFF space (complicates after hours events) 
*** Have not discussed any terms or numbers
*** EFF moving out of the rest of the space around Jan/Feb 2009 - expansion possibility
*** Has several walls in there that we could try to cut out
*** Can support maybe 40 people in there at once if _very_ crowded?
*** Space visit next Monday or Tuesday at roughly 6pm. Watch the list. 
** Jim asked about what the configuration of the space might be
*** Talked about shelves + workspaces, tables + chairs, but bring your own laptop
*** Talked about multi-week reservations of pieces of space for projects
* Paperwork
** We talked about vision, inspiration by European hacker spaces, etc. 
** Talked about finances
*** Expectation that tech job people contribute more
*** See Finances page on wiki, put up pledge if you can
** Bylaws: David M. thinks Nolo member bylaws are cool, will edit Wiki for Thursday night meeting 
** Question about whether more artists or techies interested
*** Some of both, people who do both (e.g. Rachel, Audrey)
*** Noah pointed out the distinction is artificial, we're trying to blur it 
** Question about whether we want to be a "Chaostreff"
*** Discussion of what the costs are (40 euro) and benefits (some money maybe, cool factor).
*** Feeling from several people that we should delay that until more established.
