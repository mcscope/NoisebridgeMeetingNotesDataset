Contact tman66@gmail.com if you need info. If you can't come, you can donate food, cleaning materials, and other stuff. You can go to our wiki at: https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge_Mini-Reboot_2017 and if you are on Slack we have a channel #mini-reboot.
* Jeremy - Bought a laminator, which will also laminate circuits. Like you can maybe put a coin cell battery in it? Don't laminate napkins. It's in the darkroom. 
* Mitch - March 18th is an Arduino for Total Newbies workshop. 50 people will be invading noisebridge and totally taking up the hackatorium from 1-4:30pm. $35 for materials. TODO(dperny) add to announcements

= Safe Space =

Torrie - Noisebridge is a safe space. This means not necessarily that oyu're protected from reality while you're here, but psychological and physical safety. If you're gonna make loud noises, you tell people to put on hearing protection so nobody gets hurt. Same with phsychological safety. If you're gonna talk about sensitive topics, prepare the people around for it. This lets people hack in peace without being distracted by psychological distractions. Unwanted romantic advances on other people are unwelcome, and there is an anti-harassment policy which is spelled out on the columns and on the fridge.

What happens if you feel unsafe? We have Slack, which is the best way to get in touch. If something is wrong/dangerous/uncomfortable, go to the #spaceguardians channel and mention that a problem is occurring, and people will help you solve it, because here at noisebridge we take care of each other.

= Participation =

J - The best way to get access is to hang out and be excellent, hack with others, make cool things, help keep the space clean and protect it. Fellow hackers are watching for people who are excellent and eventually you will be asked if you want RFID access to the space.One way that J gives access is that if people show up to CHM five times and show progress in their skill, help others, help the class, he will give you access to Noisebridge.  

Darryl - You get on slack by getting in touch with someone who has access and they will add you. You do have to be here a whole bunch to get in.  There is also a public IRC channel which you dont need permission for.

= [[Philanthropist|Philanthropists]]=

Roger - A philanthropist is someone who donates regularly to the space. In return, they get 24 access to the space. To become a philanthropist you need the endorsement of 1 member. Your name is read out at a noisebridge meet and barring any objections you become a philanthropist

Drew - Being a philanthropist isn't a "buy it and you're done" sort of thing. You're also taking more responsibility for the community. Including giving tours, looking after the space, and closing the space at night.

Drew - Rules and schools are tools for fools.

James is in the binder but he still needs a sponsor.

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

Torie - Membership at noisebridge is a commitment that you make. It's like you being married to the space without the christian connotations. By becoming a member you're saying you care deeply, passionately about noisebridge, and you want to make a statement about that. You want Noisebridge to become more, better, and forever. It's about a deep deep emotional connection (also fincial commitment)

The process is to get 2 members who are in good standing, and your application is read out 4 weeks in a row. If nobody objects to your membership, you are consensused upon

Noisebridge means different things to different people but it's definitely important.

* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

Names in the binder

Lizzie on week 3
Miloh on week 2

= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank: $54,530.65
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials
= Consensus =

J - 2 types: little c consensus, for when you want to, say paint a wall. You ask around and if people are happy with it, it gets done. There is also Big C Consensus, for when you want to tear down half the build, and when it needs to be talked about and gone through meetings. Everyone member in good standing has an opportunity to say no.

Roger - Big C Consensus is for existential changes.

Torrie - Big C Consensus from a cultural perspective. For big decisions, we want the complete buy-in at Noisebridge. There is no better way to do this than proposing a thing and talking about it at meetings.

J - Also, Big C is like for when new members are added to noisebridge. 

Mitch - Consensus is a process. It takes a minimum of 2 weeks. If someone has a Consensus Proposal, it should be discussed before, and then it's brought up at a meeting. The discussion happens, the proposal changes until everyone is happy, or until it's tabled. In a healthy consensus process shouldn't happen. It's a powerful statement that means, "as a member of this organization, I in good conscious cannot continue to be a member if this proposal continues as-is." This is a last resort, and if the process goes well, everyone should be trying to make each other happy. The exception is Consensus of a new member, which can be blocked on as little as a bad feeling. All of the members have to have a good feeling.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''
None!

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''
None!

= Discussion =

Longer discussion items belong here.  This is the last part of the meeting so that people can break off and continue their discussion afterwards.

Torie - noisebridge cultural immune system, and what it means.
Ash - offers to come in on a weekend to put together some sensors to detect GSM stuff
J - Mini-reboot
Jeremy - Laminator
Mitch - Chabot Space Center in Oakland is having an event and is looking for orgs around the Bay Area to collaborate and show off cool projects
Darryl - Tomorrow is a light up protest sign workshop


== Discussion Items ==

If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

GSM Sensors
* What about these sensors?
* Ash - Based on a RPi, with a GSM modem, about 150 bucks.
** Server side you can run on AWS or maybe at Noisebridge
** Can be done with 2 cores and a nominal 4gb of RAM
** Drew - taht sounds like a mac mini
** A saturday or a sunday to set up and show off
** You can run them at home or abroad.
** Cellular Anomily Detection - detect changes in network infrastruct, like MITM devices.
*** So basically, 2 prong approach. SDR tracks power per channel over time. The GSM modem actually looks at the cell tower metadata. 
*** This can be correlated with a bunch of other data.
* Infrastructure-wise, the only things we have are SUPER-CRITICAL THINGS. The Rack is like moderately public, and could be modified. Noisebridge.net is run by some other people but it's jsut that. We also have Ratchet which is another server. #rack can help. 
* Does March 19th sound good?
** Mitch - check the wiki and make sure nothing is happening that day/time in events. If it isn't, just add it to the wiki. You can also post to the announce email list, if you have all of the details down.

Mini-reboot!
* How many people love noisebridge, raise your hand
** Patrick and Victoria abstain
* J tweaked the mini-reboot poster
* How do we implement the mini-reboot
** In our wiki, we have a list of things that we actually need, starting with supplies
** https://donate.noisebridge.net/projects/mini-reboot
*** We need a donation page for supplies, can someone make that? We need that.
** If you're interested in doing particular work, like installing a UPS on the access control system, the items are on the wiki. Put your name down to claim a project so we get an idea of what is covered
** If you have access to slack, #mini-reboot
* Mitch has CO sensors, 9 of them, and will be installing them
* Jeremy asks about the fire extinguishers.
** They've been service recently.
** How often need inspection? Once a year.
** December 11th 2016
* J - Lately the automatic door system has been flaky downstairs, maybe because of the rain. Sometimes it doesn't buzz, sometimes it doesn't stay buzzed, or it doesn't make noise,
* Henner - The stripe needs to be replaced with one with the right voltage rating.
** Darryl - ~Charlie is planning on working on this during the reboot~
** Torrie - the power that runs to it is 24V AC, and the last couple are rated for either 12VDC or 24VAC.
** Henner - it's 24V because it's an unregulated transformer. The resistance is too low, and a couple of resistors have been added to help something.
** J - Charlie is down to work on the camera.
* J - Any other important minireboot items? 
* Plan is to get as much E-Waste out over the as possible. E-waste places have been contacted, including a place on 16th that will take it for free. We can borrow a pallet rack and and drag it down there. Recology will take other stuff that we have to pay for (Like the old tube monitors). Maybe someone on the account can call them up? TV tubes, for example, cost money. 


Mitch - Chabot
* Email mitch or hit him up on slack or see him in the space
* They're not looking for anything specific, just like cool projects.
* The event is all ages, so if you make cool stuff, maybe bring it? 
* April 22nd
