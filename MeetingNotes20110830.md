Miloh welcomes people, and then gives a consensus process pitch.

Rubin interrupts to explain sudo-o-cracy.

Miloh says THINGS WORK, YAY!


* [[Consensus Process|A brief primer on consensus process]]: We agree and so should you! Only paid-up members can block consensus.

=== Short Announcements ===

Cool new projects? Something you'd like people to know? Say now, but keep it short!

==== Hacker Equality site/group ====

At CCC camp, there was a radio talk program, including Mitch, and others, about
queers and geeks. We talked about tolerance and equality and diversity --
tolerance for people who use vim or emacs, tabs and spaces, and boys and girls
and others.  We would like to start a group to encourage accepting other
hackers for what they are. So Rubin is going to start a site for
hacker_equality, and encourage hackerspaces to join the movement, and sign up.

JOIN HIM. JOIN HIM.

=== New or Stale Events ===


==== Noisebridge 3 Year Anniversary and Hacker Prom, October 1st ====

Johannes is doing Arse Electronica again, where the Austrian government pays to
ship him to San Francisco to talk about sex. So lots of people here talking
dirty.

And we'll also be planning the annual Noisebridge party -- it will be hacker
prom themed. We'll have tuxes, colored lights, awkward dance, chaperones, and
awkward photos. 

Contact [[User:Rubin110|Rubin]] if you would like to help. 

Rubin encourages Miloh to create sudo pop again.


=== Financial Report ===

Miloh demands a financial report.

THere is an awkward silence, then Kelly goes:

Funds in bank: $18,859.14

We're really really very close to having three months advance operating
expenses, even when we've dug down into paying the full amount. 

We have 45 members, and 14 regular donors.
31 regular, 18 people paying starving hackers, 2 doing well hackers.

=== Membership Binder ===

* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Write a check on every open application.

* Anyone up for joining this week (ie have four checks by their name + have two sponsors) should introduce themselves then leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime) for the rest of the group. The rest of the meeting should consense on whether they may join.

=== Consensus items ===

''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current_Consensus_Items|Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

=== Discussion Items ===

Mike talks about the computer that was broken, and asked someone to fix it. Leif said yes.

==== Tor Project Report ====

Tor project has now $411, 8% of which will be skimmed off by Noisebridge for
"expenses" and "flowers and dining costs" and "pajama requirements" and
"entertainment" and 3% "Paypal" "charges". We are actively looking around for
hosting providers.  We are looking for hosting providers, with .5GB or more
pipe, where they can put a linux box in a supportive environment.

=== End of Meeting ===
