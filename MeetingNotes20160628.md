* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to explain''' [[Noisebridge_Vision|what Noisebridge is about]]:
&lt;blockquote>Noisebridge is a 501c3 nonprofit that provides a space for creation, collaboration, and learning about technology and creative projects. Noisebridge provides space, power tools, and infrastructure to help the public learn new skills and create cool things. Noisebridge continues to exist through and depends entirely on membership fees and donations. Our code of conduct is 'Be excellent to each other'."&lt;/blockquote>

Rob: Noisebridge is about plastic, cooling plastic, and forming plastic.
Nick: I agree!

Ian:  learning thing hacking things, it's pretty cool to be here

Nick: makes stuff, increasingly h/w stuff  
Hunter: 1st time here - looking at slack apps
David:  Works on application stacks (I heard the word 'rails' that's cool!)
Daryle:  Helps out painting-wise
Tayopa:  Misses playing around with physical h/w stuff.  She's a pro congnitive scientist 
Lee:  Working on speach recognition and tts.  Want's to build a __??? named ??
Javin:  Unity, C# game dev
Jaslin:  Just here for w/e
Ryan:  Been coming to nb for quite a while.  Does a little bit of everything.. making stuff/ hacking stuff.  Right now here for gamebridge after meeting.  Love seeing what ppl are up to.
Levi:  Here from a long time ago, coming back to it.  Biting off more than can chew programming code.  
Rob: Learning assembly and c at same time - mandatory.  Way more than I can chew, but it's dockerized!!1!  It compiles!
Allen: professional ex-programmer.  Worked my way up to the cloud.  Used to work for sun and motorola. Interests all over the map. Messing with the Unreal engine for animation stuff.  Pulled to exotic energy.  Interested in magnetic motors.
Scotty:  I'm a programmer, ee h/w, really into ESP...6s , can do all kinds of cool stuff like run the cool LED units (points around).    








* Introduce any experimental or unusual moderation techniques that may be using during the meeting like: direct responses, limited speaking time, orderless stack, &amp;c.
* Round of introductions (remember, announcements come later):
** What's your name
** What do you do
** What do you maintain at Noisebridge?
** if you are new: how did you hear about Noisebridge?

= Short announcements and events =
* Cool new projects? Something you'd like people to know? Say now, but keep it short! One or two sentences please!
* Any happenings at the space of which members should be made aware.
* Don't hog everyone's time since we all just want to hack!

Allen is bringing up a Tesla project thing.  There's supressed knowledge  http://teslatech.ino  

Ryan:  Once we get the lazerz I plan on teaching the lazers, both basics and complex raster vectore, ingraving, cutting multiple materials.  Once we get the lazer I'll try to pick a good day and figure out how we'll get materials.  

Scotty:      security-wg is where NB is discussing the replacement to the security camera.  




= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.


Tayopa:  There are many ways to become a member.... you're taking on responsibilitys.  While this is a community where... we consens... only an actual member can 'block' an issue that has come up.  
.... Lot's more talk about the 4 week thing.  


Lee:  Reads from binder:  
    Printed ~Nym~ is Scotty Allen.
    ....reads from Scotty's application.  
    




= [[Philanthropists]]=
* '''Invite a knowledgeable member to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

Nick:  Phil is really similar to membership... I do believe that 'member' has legal remifications.  A philps is a member who has a reoccuring subscription... 24h access.  I'm a philanthropist, Lee is, Scotty.  It's people who want to make NB stronger.  You become a philanthropist by getting one other member to vouch for you, you go over the rules and policies.  We have some rules to the space, we have norms.. it's do-ocratic.  Always talk to people to get a warning/ heads up to get the gist of what to do/not do.  



We need more cash.






= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank:
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

Scotty:  We have some money in the bank.... it's probably enough.... some of it is noise-force.

Lee:  it seems like it's a _thing_ it's 

Allen:  Why does noise-tour cost money?  




= Consensus and Discussion =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.


Nick:  Consensus is really only used when it's a really big item.  If you don't concent something, it's like.. what do you not like about what's happening ....... If you are blocking a consensus item, then it should be something you feel so strongly about that you would leave noise bridge were that issue to be passed as is.  ...... So....  local consensus (lower case c) ..... it's my favorite part of NB... it's the differnetiating feature between us and like... tech shop.  

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''
broken.  
== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

Nothing to consense

== Discussion Items ==

If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

Lee:  Why the camera is... it's broken because someone (a druggy dude) smashed it with his skateboard.  He made a scene...... I don't think I made a biggggg mistake.. but what some people mentioned might have gone wrong...   So basically some ppl brought some dogs in... they looked drug related.  

Scotty:  this is an after meeting thing.


Allen:  where does the camera status sit now.  

Lee:  
    
Scotty:  I think Rubin ordered one (a new security camera)


Nick:  I think a later convo w/ a smaller grp would be good (how to give tours, etc.) having a better system for how to do that, etc. etc. issues with the wiki... issues with ppl not having access who should have access, and also.  

Nick:  I like to think of this in terms of goals.
  Ppl who are a part of the space (healthy) can sometimes have trouble getting into the space.  
  I started building a slack extension as a way to update the mediawiki.  Also there's a feature for asking question if they're in the space. 
  earlier this week a big ass fridge got shipped here... like a big  one.  It was huge.......  
  The other issue is door access, limited by members.  With slack I know I have a way to get someone in the 
  
Lee:  what about key signing as a solution?  

Scotty:  We as a community have 'vetted members'... that's kind of a.... a way of filter and supporting door access.


Nick:  
    
    
Lee:  Perhaps we can have a system of delegation

T:  It sounds nice but isn't that how some trouble has happened in the past...   'describes flood of non-desireable, non-hackers gaming the system'

Nick:  We can create a threshold system, where it takes a couple trusted people... that can 


Scotty:  2 thoughts... we need moar members....   More philathropists should apply for membership (looks at Lee).  2)  I feel comfortable going straight to a member and vouching for someone to be granted door access (though am a non-member, I'm trusted to have made a good judgement).  
    

X:  How does door access work?

Scotty:  [RFID]

Daryle:  



Scotty:  The process involves Henner.  If you become a philanthropast you get 24h access.....

Lee:  idk, in terms of... (ponders)  I can see there's a case for abuse, but if there's 1 degree from a member...  


Nick:  Do I understand correctly, if I want to get someone access, I need only scan their RFID, and then get that token to Henner, and then Henner can remotely add this NB partisipant to NB's door system.

Lee:  you could send to Henner an RFID that has 3 GPG signatures ..... such that the RFID door access grant can be automated.


Nick:  Access is huge...  it's one of the key components to our success....  it's one of the reasons we're growing... by increasing access to the space.

Scotty:  Sound like something worth talking about.



Scotty:  I wanted to proppose a that we add a new section to the meeting...   where we mention that it's a safe space... and we ask someone to describe this.... to increase visibility of that desired quality of our space.  



T:  Safe space as a phrase came up as having a negative connotation.  

X:  Sounds like the general thing, we're working on a culture....   do we wanna call it a safe space or not.... the space has changed... I think it's a cool idea.


Levi:  Things like "trigger warnings" and safespace... sometimes using language that does not involve these buzz words.  .... A lot has changed... really greatful to see that change, all teh new faces and people.  ...subtlety is a lot like.... I've been to a lot of places that say they're a safe space, and they're really not.  


Scott:  you're saying don't use specific words.??

Levi:  ...no... there are some words to some people that come off as really abrasive...   Use lang


Scotty:  Totally agree.... Id' like to see the tone of this portion of the meeting to be open and receptive to ppl who don't know a whole lot about the language of talking about this.  I'm not


t:  me too..


Daryle:  ...


Levi:


T:  If we can work it in some way where not anyone _has to_ agree...

Lee:  there already is a code of contact...

Scotty


Nick:  anti harrasment seems like we're setting a bar where.... (Rob:  the fan near me cooling plastic is soooo loud.....)

Scotty:  I'm really open to where this discussion is headed... we care about hte space being comfortable for everybody...   

T:  this was brought up because of Jaccob Applebaum.... and that is obviously an important thing to define our policyies to protect us from.   Sometimes ppl don't think about how their actions affect others... it's not necisarily obvious...  if someone grabs you... that's obvious.... i....  it's valuable to have it an ongoing thing at the meeting.....  Sometimes well meaning ppl don't realize what they're doing... so discussion at the meeting .....


Lee:  if there are some guidlines... it would ease enforcement...  if you're a member of the community... and everyone agrees 


Allen:  I think having a weekly thing will help us have a pulse on it (the 'safe-space' issue)

Scotty:  What should we use as our first prompt for moderators to start a meeting section with.  

Scotty:  The meeting is _not_ a good time to talk about specific incidents... also not a good time to talk about drug issue incidents...  The Jacob Applebaum was a special case to release a solidarity with the victims thing...  you raise a good point... when/where IS a good place to bring up issues of safespace that are hard to report.  


Lee:  so having an inclusive way to...

T:  more than that... sometimes you're just venting... not everything needs to be a huge deal...   

Scotty: let's get back to the brainstorm...  I believe we want to mention the anti-harrasment policy.... maybe a describe in your own words, the space thing... there should be some discussion around our values... and how the policy supports that....  


Lee:  mission statment/ vision statment, what's that terminology...

Scotty:  I like the idea of taking the temperature of the room.    giving new ppl to the community an opportunity to ask questions and see what our values are.  


Allen:  I think it also be helpful to get comments from a 'fresh set of eyes'

Lee:  it encourages action rather than inaction...  talking on it every week kind of brings it back around...

T:  it's 

Nick:  I think it's a great issue for a subcommitting... I'm part of.....  We're tring to come up w/ ways to see what makes the space better......  sit down and have a convo to see how to build infrastructure to support the space on this issue.

Ryan:  I've been looking into this a lot recently... i've noticed .... a lot of people don't like talking about .... like I don't know anyone else who does it, but having the ability to councel ppl is very important.... I'm a counselor for a lot of my friends... with issues like this talking is really helpful.  almost 80% of those movies at the film festival would have no plot if they had just talked .  we're mostly about hacking and ee... it would be interesting to see if we had any actual licensed therapists... and such... 

Chris: I think a way to make the space better would be to have a group of members who are elected by consensus... so ppl we trust who ppl can go to to talk...  I don't think we have a place....


Scotty:  we have a safe-space working group... but it's got cobwebs... (non visible...?)

Levi:  skill share to get interpersonal help.  

T:  that's probably a preferable solution....  in the past... we discussed it was a hacking place for activism and such that had social support on the side... not the other way around.    We've done depression counselor visits in the past... I think it went welll......   *concerns raised about non-licensed couselors helping pppl*

Scotty:  
    
Levi:  I'm just thinking of ways to get counselor skills into NB


Scotty:  It's important to me that we get...... maybe doing it in the full meeting wasn't such a good time to figure out the new section addition...  Meet after this meeting to continue discussion.



Levi:  if you're tech illiterate, how do I get into the tech world...  have to learn some programming languages in a month.  

Ryan:  you can just show up at any of the lectures (example, gamebridge... sometimes we have multiple people teaching the class).
