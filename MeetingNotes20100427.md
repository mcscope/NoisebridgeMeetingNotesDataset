We also need a stylist, an A/V person (or two), models, and assistance with video processing.

=== Discussion Items ===

* Is anyone willing to accept checks for membership dues via USPS?

* Fedex account would be nice to get samples from some companies.
** Meredith looking into it.
* The voicepulse account used by the phone at the space has $50 of cash in it and needs to be spent!
