=== Consensus items: ===
Budget discussion, Shannon wants $15k for the buildout.  We've spent $3k already.  That's about what we have in the bank.  Do we want to spend that and assume we can raise more?  Some of the $16k pledges have come in, some have not.  $9000 not rec'd according to wiki, need actual numbers from Mitch.  $2500 of marked donated already should get employer matching funds too, $1750 of uncollected donations should get matched.

budget breakdown is on a google doc, linked on the wiki.

big expenses remaining are electrical, kitchen, HVAC (unknown)

propose making sure the wall for the kitchen is built with a drain (by Scott while he's there) and the electrical work, but postpone full kitchen buildout for next month or so.

HVAC contractor coming on Friday, no estimate or anything has happened yet.

we have already spent $350 on SCADA, $2365 on floor.  budget is being updated as we go along.

concern that the budget is not detailed enough; pointed out that it can't be fully detailed yet.

* consense on spending $15k? No, we don't have the money, or at least we aren't sure we have it.
* consense on spending $10k? Yes, we are pretty confident we can swing that.
