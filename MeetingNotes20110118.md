=== Discussion ===

Question: Do the weekly activities listed at Meeting actually happen regularly?

Answer: Generally, yes, although people have slowly been starting up after the vacation. If you turn up to something and there's no-one there, please post to nb-discuss and make a note on the wiki, so we know to nudge someone and eventually remove it from the list.

Question: Can we move that pile of crap by the elevator?

Answer: The pile of crap by the elevator is stuff to be taken to the dump. There is a communal sense that somebody is coming to get it, and take it to the dump in mid-February. If others wish to take part or all of it to the dump or anywhere else before then, that is fine.

=== Election ===
