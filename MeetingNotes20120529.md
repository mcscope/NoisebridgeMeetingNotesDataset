== [[Membership Binder]] ==
* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Write a check on every open application.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

== Financial Report ==
* Funds in bank: $18125.77 -- lower than we would like. 
* NoiseTor $2165.20

== Consensus items ==
You may wish to '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to repeat '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on the consensus process]].

=== Proposals from last week ===

''(Add any items which pass or are blocked to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

=== Proposals for next week ===

''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

* Proposal: ban Rob 2.0 because he has not attempted mediation, and keeps coming to Noisebridge even though he's not welcome here.

== Discussion Items ==

* Rob 2.0

Cobalt says that Rob 2.0 only deals with people on IRC. 
Jake says Rob said that Mitch said he could come to the space. We clarify that Mitch has not said anything of the sort to Rob.

Cobalt says: we did do mediation, me and Kelly, I felt that he got an idea of
what was going on. I don't know if he necessarily was comfortable going
forward. I didn't have time. From Rob's point of view, he's not a sketchy dude. I consider myself a social engineer and a creepy dude. I've dealt with Rob 2.0. In my personal opinion, we've had worse issues.

Tom says: So, about six months ago, Noisebridge reached consensus that Rob 2.0
was not welcome in the space pending mediation. Since that time, he has been
unable to conclude any effective mediation. Kelly has not made attempts at
mediation, and despite recently considering her being a non-neutral moderator,
has not made attempts to find a new moderator. Despite being unwelcome at
Noisebridge, he's repeatedly turned up. That combination of defying the
consensus and failing to make meaningful attempts to fix the problems.

Monad proposes that it not be permanent, but based on him doing something to
remediate himself.

Danny points out we've put in a "until further notice" in the last banning to cover this eventuality. He'll look at the historical record to find out what the langage was.

Kelly says that she had a few phone calls, and he was paranoid and
uncooperative. Any time she tried to discuss his actual behavior. His favourite topic was Rubin stealing his rack. We explained that was within the parameters of Noisebridge.

Miloh says a ban doesn't change his actual behaviour.

Tom thinks a ban needs to be a stronger statement to help fix the behaviour.

Will says he can corroborate what Kelly says: he is very averse to talking about his own behaviour. 

Jake said that Rob turned up 3.30am, and I told Rob he had to go, and he tried
to talk his way out of it. I asked him are you refusing to leave. And he left.
He was saying "What's your problem with you? Who are you to represent the whole hackerspace". It will make it very clear to him.

Kelly stated that Rob responded with rob us, hack "our shit", get the police
involved. Kelly does not want to be mediator.

* Criminousness. Danny would like to point out that you shouldn't conduct criminal activities on Noisebridge, and to do so there is a general consensus that it befits an insta-banning.

* Miloh has been receiving donations on behalf of Noisebridge, that would be  then sold for Noisebridge funds. Kelly is uncomfortable with this. The treasurer hasn't verified it. Kelly is worried about obligations. If it comes in with cash, it's very simple. If it comes in with kind, disposing is not an easy. Kelly's principle concern is that she's not competent.

* Miloh offers to pay for a CPA. Danny suggests working with Internet Archive.
