 &lt;!-- best practices for meeting notes template.  
 #1 copy the template to the correct date for the upcoming meeting
 #2 edit the meeting notes date to reflect the date of the meeting
 #3 edit the meeting number to reflect the nth meeting of Noisebridge 
 #4 (wish all this was programmatic!)
 #5 this page often 'dead-ends' and is consequently difficult to navigate usefully.  Add and update links in the meeting notes template as necessary to make the notes more dynamic and useful for all

Miloh plugs Brewster's Friday lunches at the Internet Archive. Also the home of SF Lan, civic wireless LAN.

=== New or Stale Events ===

Ruby hacking has gone to Another Place, but we will be starting a new one it sounds like.

=== Financial Report ===
Funds in bank: TK. We are fine. REPEAT FINE.

=== Membership Binder ===
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Write a check on every open application.
* Anyone up for joining this week (ie have four checks by their name + have two sponsors) should introduce themselves then leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime) for the rest of the group. The rest of the meeting should consense on whether they may join.

=== Consensus items ===

''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current_Consensus_Items|Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

=== Discussion Items ===

Kelly explains that the method for moving hiatus members to non-members is tricky, because it has some awkward edge cases. Wanted to put it out there so that people don't get caught unawares.

Leif felt strongly one way, and then changed his mind.

Miloh points out that all groups will have more old members than current members.

Miloh suggests coming up with a definition for next week.

Kelly is going to work on [[Membership]], and will propose new rules at [[Membership Hiatus]].

Miloh is working on a reprap event, has parts for two more repraps and is having fun, Wednesday nights at 5pm

Spacebridge is having another launch this Saturday. Apparently, welding supply stores are the cheapest place for helium this side of the Sun.
