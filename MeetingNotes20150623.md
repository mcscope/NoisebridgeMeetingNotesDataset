== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''
=== Philanthropist ===
* Kevin - Why in proposal is the secretary the only person adding/removing RFID tokens?
* Patrick - This is for simplicity. In reality the responsibility will be delegated to many.
* Patrick - Channeling inner Rubin.. Pledge is a really good thing. Affirms the anti-harrassment policy and other unspoken expectations of participants at Noisebridge. Generates another revenue stream for Noisebridge.
* Kevin - Feel it might be a good idea to wait. Big change and only 3-4 members in good standing at the meeting.
* Steve - Was discussed last week. Is a big change. Don't know how the number of members presents relates to passing a proposal. Agree that members should all be informed what's going on. This has been up for three weeks. It's the responsibility of NB members to keep informed.
* Miles - Idea to fill the void of giving up access to everybody. Everyone knows who has access.
* Patrick - This was up for consensus last week. Was frozen. No alterations made. Have not heard alternate proposals or amendments. Would be happy to see it go through.
* Alex - Only visible changes since last week are finalization to pledge. In a form that's ready to go. No changes to the rules, cleaner and better written now.
* Kevin - Why does this require consensus?
* Patrick - Codifies access. Wide ranging change that effects membership. Members will be required to sign the pledge.
* Alex - more or less how membership at CBase works. Start donation ==> recognition and access before becoming a permenent member.
* Dan - was at the meeting last week, been thinking about a lot of the details. I'm glad to see this come up for consensus. Represents some sense of confidence that consensus is a process worth going though. Give people a chance to voice their concerns. Last week had the discussion about waiting. This is worth giving a try. A lot depends on implementation. I cannot see anything to change. Hoping that as this is implemented sticking points will be addressed through doacracy or consensus.
* Dan - I recently became a member of high76 in Philly. We have a "dismember" $15/month. You come on open nights, and have access to mailing list and other things. It's a way to get more recurring donations. 
* Kevin - It's both a way to raise money and codify access control.
* Danny - Would anyone need to sign this that doesn't know about it?
* Patrick - I believe anyone who needs to sign this would be aware of it
* Kevin - What would happen if a member refuses to sign the pledge?
* Patrick - I think that would be controversial as it's kinda the expecations of being a member but written down
* Dan - I think the sticking point is having to clear house at 10pm.
* Patrick - There is no expectation or requirement to clear house at 10pm, only that if you are the last 24/7 person out after 10pm that you close the space.
* Maria - I recently started coming back to noisebridge. People are excercising autonomy in this already.
* Steve - RE: a current member refusing to sign this, do we revoke their membership. Absolutely not. You're still a member. 
* Kevin - I'll stand aside if folks feel ready to do this tonight.
* Dan - Would be good to revisit in 3-6 months.
* Patrick - This is perfectally experimental.
