=== Announcements ===

=== Financial Report ===
Funds in bank: 
By SMS (the treasurer in Absentia, handled by moderater) our Bank balance is currently $8156 which is sig. less than our desired bank balance of $15k.  This is not good and we should take whatever steps we can to improve our funding situation.  We are spending money somewhat faster than we are bringing it in.

We are supported by: 

Donations from the Community
Membership dues ($40 t0 $80)
Note the employers in the area tend to match donations from folks

=== Project Updates ===

=== Consensus items ===

=== Discussion Items ===

*27c3 whatup   -miloh
The 27th Chaos Communications Congress put on the 27th 28th and 29th of December in Berlin.  If there is any way you can swing it, go.
It costs $80 Euros and is PRESALE ONLY (because of OVERCROWDINg?).  There are 2 group apartments worth of people from the NB community going.

*Miloh wants to go and fund it all on Sudo Pop.  Please come and buy bottles and 6packs of SudoPop novelty liquid from him at Circuit Hacking Monday and Tuesdays.
Use Airhitch and search for cheap airfare 

*Hacker Mobile proposal -frantisek
"Hacker Mobile"
"I want to find out what other people think about creating a mobile hacker space..."  
Frantisek wants to get wheels and explore this idea with other interested people, with the goal of starting a hackerspace in Mexico.  He wants to share in transportation with like minded hackers and rebuild a vehicle in a way that it can be used to tour other hackerspaces on a trip towards Mexico.  
Tentative Itinerary:  a few weeks in January 2011 heading down to Mexico. 
There is a discussion about the goal to spawn new hackerspaces on the trip as well as visiting extant hackerspaces along the route.
"Hacker outward bound"  -- Shannon
Frantisek proposes to test the bus on a West Coast leg for a few weeks in January, then head to Chiapas, Mexico to work on hackerspace culture for about a month.
A discussion of possibilities ensues.

*User shelves -  request for more space -- if you can share your shelf  -miloh
AND label your shelf accordingly --- 
Come and claim your shelf, take care of it well labelled and 

*Drink run to Costco.   Need to raise $500 for thirsty noisebadger drinks, or not.- miloh

*Tastebridge has Kombucha available!  You can bottle your own or get it from the Drinks Fridge (we have 2 fridges, one  is for experiements)

*Fully functioning open source clothing exchange at Noisebridge  Located in the Crafty area --
Feel free to exchange clothing and bring clothing in to alter and make your own.

*DMCA takedown complaint from Monkeybrains -- The heresay is that Monkeybrains called today (10/26) to inform us of a takedown complaint.
The internet service here is available in the form of unfiltered open wifi AP's.  
Please do not use the Noisebridge network download.  Ask administrators about what you want to do with the Network to find the best use of our limited bandwidth!

*Monkeybrains connection is a 802.11N wifi link.  It 

*Dedicated access to more DSL circuits is possible, see DrJesus (email the rack list) to hash out details for its use.  
 
*Alternate service methods:  
Mike Blade introduces the Mifi card he uses when the Noisebridge network is down.  Bandwidth is greater than DSL in certain cases.  Its a monthly subscription that would offer a better guarantee than the sometimes more limited bandwidth available at Noisebridge.  Anyone interested in sharing some mifi accounts for use at the space should discuss with Mike Blade or on the Nb-Discuss.  Affinity groups may be interested.

*How To Fix the Network when it breaks:  
If you want to help out when the network is down
Empower yourself by reading the Network Troubleshooting resources page
Get yourself familiarized with the Noisebridge Wiki

*Shit What Needs Done:
This is a new To-Do page for Noisebridge, Jof is working on the items on this list. He's already added 'How To Help Out' buttons on the Touchpanels that you can use to find out what needs to be done.  See the Noisebridge wiki or the touch panels

*You can donate whatever you want as long as its not toxic waste or a CRT, but if you donate a resource and do not guide its use, then it is possible that it may get turned into a ROBOT.  Yes, a ROBOT:  a lifeless husk of wood and plastic.  See the lifeless foosball table for an example. --Adi

*Nick organizes the bay area LISP and Scheme with the Bay area Closures group, he came by to see if the space could support a 40-50 person meetup.
Preferred procedure is to find a member to sponsor the group's meeting.   The idea is to have a meeting for this group in the future, the date depends on the availability of the presenters, look out for it in late November.  

*Noisebridge is NOT for sleeping.  Do not sleep at Noisebridge.  A PSA from Shannon.

*Rodrigo has delivery of a physical Packet from the Budapest hackerspace -  The packet is sent to the designated available open port, Leif R.
Thank you Budapest!
