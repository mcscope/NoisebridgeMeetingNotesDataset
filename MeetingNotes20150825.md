&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

'' Miloh: I Just few back from CCC Camp in Germany and my thumbs sure are tired. Report back bullet points: ''

* Camp had an extremely impressive infrastructure. It rivaled or beat infrastructure at many permanent US hackerspaces, hands down. 
* [https://media.ccc.de/browse/conferences/camp2015/camp2015-6983-infrastructure_review.html#video&amp;t=330 Review the infrastructure talk]
* Respect for the [https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/The_Shower_Pattern shower pattern] 
* Good Clean hacker Fun.&lt;br> [[File:DominoHackerAesthete_web.jpg | 400px | Mr Domino]]
* [https://media.ccc.de/browse/conferences/camp2015/ Fahrplan] filled with tons of well [recorded  talks to watch for learning or inspiration for projects 
* [https://events.ccc.de/2015/08/21/towards-a-greener-cccamp/ Greener] camp in four years? Start sketching out contributions now
* Even though [http://toorcamp.toorcon.net/ toorcamp]site is out of date, look for Toorcamp June 2016 in Washington State. More accessible for a wider cross section. Bug the organizers with ''I hear dabout this cool hacker camp you are holding, where do I sign up?''
* ''What's all this [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio SDR] stuff, anyway?'' &lt;br>With the [https://github.com/rad1o rad1o] camp badge, thousands of SDRs (software defined radios) were unleashed on unassuming &amp; completely ego-free global hackers. Somehow this dovetails well with [https://libreplanet.org/wiki/Save_WiFi saving wifi]. What happens next, is really up to us. 
* After 1 brilliant puff, German PopKorn Kanone shut down under threat of expulsion from camp! &lt;br> [[File:KanonePopKorn.jpg |96px | popcorn]]&lt;br> Not to worry, USA puffing cannon lives on, and will be outfitted for tc2016!
* Noisebridgers wore Hotpants
