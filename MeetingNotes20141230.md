 These are the notes from the [https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Category:Meeting_Notes The 341st Meeting of Noisebridge].

Note-taker: (evil) Dan; Moderators: n/a (small group, brief meeting)

'''Drama-free holiday season at NB, so far so good.  New Years Eve tomorrow: plan on NB being generally "closed" possibly earlier than 10 PM - sorry, not looking to entertain much Mission party scene, boisterous drunks, etc.  That said, expecting a few volunteers will be here to keep an eye on the place and enjoy a quiet vibe New Years Eve.  Doorbell not currently working - for access contact (415) 530-7661 / check other [[Gate_keepers]].'''
