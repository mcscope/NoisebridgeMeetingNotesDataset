= Discussion Notes =

Discussion item: Should Andrew Byrne be allowed to come back to a meeting?

Charlie talks about conflicts between himself, Pigeon, Kevin. It is not
clear how this is related to Andrew.

The people who most directly accused Andrew of sexual misconduct in email
did not come to the meeting to propose banning him.
Ronald and Jarrod join on the proposal of having a secondary meeting, not
the general one, and specifically inviting the people who raised personal
objections

Pigeon proposes instead of discussing banning Andrew in particular. Ari
doesn't think that would be a workable solution.

Madelynn suggests reaching out to the two people and making them a specific
part of the committee meeting to address whether to invite Andrew back.

We are not going to reach consensus tonight, but Tom says people interested
in coming to a secondary meeting should write to nb-discuss to identify
their interest.
