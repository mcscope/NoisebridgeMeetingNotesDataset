Noisebridge has introduced itself to us and we have introduced ourselves to noisebridge so we're good. We're going to touch on things briefly.

Participation - "anyone can participate".
Safe space - " Noisebridge is considered a safe space because we want people to hack, especially people who don't have other venues to hack"
Victoria - glad it's a sentence.

Membership binder. You can be a member of the noisebridge if you want.

What's a member? What do you think? Chill out and work on things here. Charlie - being a member is different than just coming here ot hack. It's more for people who want to demonstrate commitment on a concrete level. You can apply to be a member and can block consensus if a big decision happens.  We'll talk about consensus later. Anyway yeah.
PBS membership! You get a badge.
Victoria - it's more like sierra club.
You get mail about board electrions. Sierra club is full of shit.

Membership binder - what's a philantropist? You're a sustaining member of PBS and get to watch all the shows at noisebridge. You get to do everything just like anyone but you can also close down the space if you're the last person. and you pay money. And you get 24/7 access.

Reader submission - lizzie wants to be a philantropist. So does chris venter and patrick minault. All accepted??

You can't block shit if you're a philantropist. and it can be revoked.  If lizzie shits in the woodshop she can stop being a philantropist. 
No one objects! am philantropist. Rights and philantropist.  Needs money.

Membership applications are in this binder. There's a long wiki page about membership. You get two members. We talk about it four weeks. We ask you personal questions. We gossip. We reveal whether or not we've consensed.

Consensus - anyone can block other members. Rationale is that person blocking may not want to explain. 

Financial reports -  ????

Explanation of Consensus - lizzie said this so didn't type it.

Victoria - blocking is more like "if this proposal happens, I will walk away from noisebridge". Block is a "slow down", not a "no".

But 99% of things are just things people do. You don't need consensus for everything. Doocracy!

Rafeal - Big C - trying to modify the physical space, or move noisebridge, or something. Little c is like "I decide we have too many oscilloscopes. let's move some."

Discussion items-
Jacob - wants to get a group for a few conferences in the summer: Defcon, a few others. Has a 2016 van. Wants to go.
Jeremy - just being a jackass. Possessed?

Jacob has a van. Wants to network with people who want to go. Exchange contact info. July 27th! Las Vegas! Defcon is the world's biggest "family oriented hacking event". Not hacking bad. Head of NSA goes. Security conference. 12h drive. There's a documentary. You can get whatever kind of experience you want. 4-day event. dontworrybehappyplease@aol.com .

Friend Ivan wants to talk about etching boards with acid and lasers.

Keita - doing a meetup about ios development. Weekend-gathering-style-meetup. We all design or discuss an ios topic. Met Ruth. Wants a key so he can do Sunday meetups.

Rosse - interviews people about corporate work environments. If someone works in a large office. Contact me@rossegates.com

= Instructions =

Congratulations and/or condolences! You're reading this because you're participating in a meeting of Noisebridge!

Meetings should be limited to an hour when possible. Shorter is fine, but avoid rushing.

You should read this instructional section thoroughly, and treat them as a guideline for how to host a meeting of Noisebridge. There are three ingredients to an [[Excellent]] meeting: A number of note takers, some facilitators, and participants.

Meetings are just one of the tools used at Noisebridge to create net forward progress on whatever it is we're all trying to do. Meetings aren't the only way to make decisions or have discussions, and in fact its usually a much better idea to talk about things outside the meeting before dragging the entire community kicking and screaming into it.

== Note Takers ==
# Confirm last meeting was saved
# Take new notes
# Save and share the notes at the end of the meeting (instructions at the bottom).

== Facilitators ==

There are generally two kinds of facilitator roles at a Noisebridge meeting:

* Stack taker - Useful when a lot of folks want to hop on the discussion stack. This gives everyone a turn to have their feelings heard. Usually only works when there is exactly one stack taker.
* Moderators - Keeps the meeting moving and prevents everyone from wasting too much time on one subject. Anyone is free to pick up moderation and move the meeting along.

In general, moderators should:
* Understand the structure of Noisebridge [[consensus|decision-making]]
* Make sure everyone gets a chance to speak.
* Speak only minimally yourself.
* Keep the meeting moving, and avoid getting bogged down.
* Identify discussion items, arrange times limits for talking about each item.
* Identify and summarize consensus, suggest things that need to be done.
* '''Get the [[membership binder]] and ensure that it is returned safely.'''

== Participants ==

Everyone at a Noisebridge meeting who has consented to participating in one is a participant!

* Say your name before you talk.
* Remain on-topic, and speak as concisely as possible.
* Assist the note-taker with any links or corrections that are needed.
* Remain respectful of other participants, their time, and the consensus and moderation process.

* '''One or two bullet points of high-level meeting summary.'''

== Meeting Summary ==
FIXME FILL OUT AT END OF MEETING AND SEND TO MAILING LIST
TLDR what happened at the meeting:
* Announcements:
* Finances:
* New members:
* New philanthropists:
* Consensus Items: 
* Discussion Items:

= Introductions =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to explain''' [[Noisebridge_Vision|what Noisebridge is about]]:
&lt;blockquote>Noisebridge is a 501c3 nonprofit that provides a space for creation, collaboration, and learning about technology and creative projects. Noisebridge provides space, power tools, and infrastructure to help the public learn new skills and create cool things. Noisebridge continues to exist through and depends entirely on membership fees and donations. Our code of conduct is 'Be excellent to each other'."&lt;/blockquote>
* Introduce any experimental or unusual moderation techniques that may be using during the meeting like: direct responses, limited speaking time, orderless stack, &amp;c.
* Round of introductions (remember, announcements come later):
** What's your name
** What do you do
** What do you maintain at Noisebridge?
** if you are new: how did you hear about Noisebridge?

= Short announcements and events =
* Cool new projects? Something you'd like people to know? Say now, but keep it short! One or two sentences please!
* Any happenings at the space of which members should be made aware.
* Don't hog everyone's time since we all just want to hack!

= Safe Space =

'''Note:''' This section is experimental.  We discussed it at [[Meeting_Notes_2016_06_28]]. We're going to try it for the next meeting, and see how it goes, and then discuss in the discussion section how it went, and how we'd like to tweak it.

Noisebridge is a safe space.  '''Invite a volunteer to describe''' what that means.

Some specific points you might prompt the group to touch on, if it doesn't happen naturally:
* What to do if you feel uncomfortable.
* Noisebridge strives to be radically inclusive. What does that mean?
* Noisebridge has an antiharassment policy. What does that mean?

= Participation =

Invite a knowledgable volunteer to describe who can participate at Noisebridge, including:
* Describe how to get an rfid key for the door system
* Describe how to get access to slack

= [[Philanthropist|Philanthropists]]=
* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.


= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank:
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

= Consensus =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''


= Discussion =

Longer discussion items belong here.  This is the last part of the meeting so that people can break off and continue their discussion afterwards.


== Discussion Items ==

If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

= End of Meeting =

# Return the [[membership binder]] to its rightful location.
# Discuss any items for which there was not time during the meeting.
# Enjoy the company of your fellow hacker, robot, or robothacker.

== Note taker posts the notes ==
# Clean and tidy the meeting notes including removing all these really verbose instructions.
# Fill out the short summary at the top listing just announcements, consensus items, discussion topics, and names of new members and philanthropists.
# Copy paste the notes to the [http://www.noisebridge.net//Next_meeting next meeting] page. (They will become [[Last meeting]] at midnight.)
# Email the meeting summary to [mailto:noisebridge-discuss@lists.noisebridge.net?subject=MeetingNotes Noisebridge Discuss] and [mailto:noisebridge-announce@lists.noisebridge.net?subject=MeetingNotes Noisebridge Announce] lists.

# Edit the [[Current_Consensus_Items|Current Consensus Items]] if anything is proposed for consensus next week.
# Edit the [[Consensus_Items_History|Consensus Items History]] if anything was reached consensus or failed to reach consensus this week.

== Fun things to do after ==
* Reprise of the [[Hackernationale]]. [This is anarchy - we do what the wiki says!]
* [[PGP|PGP Key Signing]] could happen now (if it doesn't happen '''before''' any given Meeting).  Ask others around the space or check the [[PGP|list]] to see who wants in on the action.
