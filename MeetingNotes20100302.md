There was a proposal to make everyone executive director. All of the attendants agreed.

Seth read some stuff from the bylaws that were actually filed.

We learned that Noisebridge does not have ED, we have a President.

Zedd said that the plumbing is finished unless something goes wrong

Also, The board should replace the President yearly, but it specifically says should.

There were massive amounts of discussion about who should be President.

Zedd was told that there was water on the floor by the bathroom, and scampered off to stop the water.

More discussion about who should be President.

Jof was decided on, because he walked in at the right moment.

Mr. President did cartwheels.

The meeting was concluded.
