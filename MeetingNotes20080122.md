== Meeting Notes ==

Roughly 10-12 people showed up for the meeting. Not everyone showed up at the same time, so we did not go through a formal agenda. Instead, we discussed the following topics at various points during the night. Please edit to add anything [[DavidMolnar]] left out:

* Insurance update
    - David Molnar reported on calling insurance agents. Two agents have promised to call back on 23/01/08 
    with more information and possibly a quote. We need a 1-paragraph description of what Noisebridge does, 
    see [[InsuranceQuestions]]. David also provided the wiki link because one of the agents needed to see a 
    web site for any new business. We will find out soon if this was a mistake.
    - David reported that one of the insurance agents wanted to know what kind of "electronics assembly" projects 
    we might do; David gave as an example the mind alteration device with LED flashing lights. The insurance agent 
    thought it was interesting. 
    - Several other agents have been messaged and should get back to David soon. 
    - We said that for now, we do not plan to do anything in the space that might be extraordinarily dangerous 

* Basement 9th and Mission update
    - Landlord has not called back yet. 

* Marc made food, and we ordered indian pizza
    - Yum! Mugwort soba, brazillian fruit sorbet, other fun stuff.

* New people showed up
    - We saw several people who had not made it to a Noisebridge meeting before. Welcome!

* Hacker space discussion
    - We talked about other spaces in the US that are hacker or art spaces
    - Public n3rd Area, Mission counterPULSE, NIMBY, etc. 
    - We talked about what we want to see from Noisebridge that is different from current groups
    - Specifically, counterPULSE rents hourly space and isn't good for long-term projects, SF Microcontroller group 
    does not have a space, NIMBY is more of a space rental and less of a community, etc.
