(Jarrod moderating, Joyti taking notes)
** Jarrod: thank you for taking the time to hang out with for a little while
Mari: NB is a 5013c electronic community....free to hack here, free to get a key here....can pay to become a member or philanthropist
Introductions:
    Henner: hacker on software by day, other stuff at night
    Mischief: hacks
    Francis: lost his computer and is here using the computers
    Eli: Sys admin
    Frank: been looking at broadband data communications technology as a new field
    Cynthia: trained in medicine and little of this and that
    Alex: video game trainer
    Mari: does all the things
    Douglas: doing audio stuff with the circuits, wants to start group to do the same, learning and teaching
    Joyti: lawyer teaching herself to code
    Kyle: making sew things
    Torrie: making things that make things
    Andrew: data analysis
    Jarrod: mostly woodworking
Jarrod: does anyone want to bring up anything//announce to the group
Mischief: plan 9 hacker - if you know C and likes weird esoteric things, maybe you want to join writing 
Mari: started a retro gaming group, first meeting NB gaming - make chip tones and other soundy things on the t.v.s in the space
Torrie: next Thursday is 5 minutes of fame, should come down at talk about subject for 10 minutes. Bring in a presentation 
Jarrod: this Thursday, grand reopening of the sewing area
Alex: sewing is science that people can wear
Jarrod: Is anyone expecting to become a member or philanthropist?
Torrie: principle objections to throw wrench in the issue -- via consensus -- which involves members -- some sort of a block -- indicates a problem -- then members talk it out until agreement is reached
Torrie: little c and big C consensus 
Alex: non-consensus is beginning of issue, not the end, indicates that the problem needs further discussion - talk about it until the meeting, which makes meeting smoother
Alex: to become a member, would have enough familiarity in community to have 2 members sponsoring you, and then show up at 4 meetings, which your membership is discussed - members can block another person from becoming a member
Jarrod: the other thing members get 24 hour access
Jarrod: what if you wanted 24 hour access without being membership - if only we had another process
Henner: you become a philanthropist. I think the process is similar - you need some sponsors, people you let in are properly greeted, shown around
Jarrod: first of all, let's take a look at the people who want to become philanthropist
Jarrod: Is Samer here? (no) Is Willy here? (no) Is Marcus here? (no) [Jarrod explains process]
Douglas: [took a philanthropist form]
Jarrod: consensus items - I am looking - and we don't have any to talk about
Jarrod: discussion items: 
    Alex: I saw a sign about refresh - is it ongoing? Is a week long?
    Henner: so there's this suggestion, to have a mini reboot, to lock up NB for a weekend, to organize and clean up for a weekend, reorganize some things that have not been used for a year, general idea to have it happen some time this month, 
    Torrie: mid-October would be a great idea - make a list of stuff - I personally was one of the people that wanted this to happen - pick a day - gives us about a month to figure stuff out
    Alex: sounds like a good time
    Jarrod: the idea is that we want to purge and reorganise for a little while
    ....does anyone have anything to add?
    Torrie: anyone have any ideas or suggestions about this?
    Alex: things that need fixing: laser cutters, printers, I personally would like to do a group about - tour materials, drawings for the space
    Douglas: organizing electronics
    Torrie: build some cool furniture and stuff here, a couch, art-wall-mural-of pinpointing hacker spaces onto it
    Alex: does anyone have access to large format printer
    Jarrod: Office Max, like $6/sheet
    Alex: do they have color
    Jarrod: yes
    Kyle: a lot of areas with furniture being pushed around, he'd be interested in organising stuff
    Henner: one thing I want to work on is a dedicated greeter 
    Henner: anyone mind us rearranging/moving things. Things that can be done while the space is open. Doesn't need to wait until the space is closed - being "mostly closed"
    Torrie: who is familiar with Twillo and wants to be added
    Alex: We have asana, which is better than Tweillo (sp?)
    Torrie: focus more on manufacturing and production in this space
    Torrie: it felt like a coworking - its just for coworking and hacking on programming stuff on your computer, and not enough on sewing and woodworking, etc
    Alex: is there already a sewing and threadworking event?
    Jarrod: we're having a reopening ceremony
    Alex: a weekly or monthly event
    Kyle: I would like to ideally have a sewing community here. Need a following to make that happen. A couple months I can be more involved. Invited a bunch of people from fabric store down the street. Organzing and buying stuff - getting help in that regard
    Torrie: shop safety class that happens every 3 months or so - have one Wednesday before the reboot
    Frank: question about the un-conference
    Torrie: the people responsible for that have been sacked
    Jarrod: anyone else have anything to add?
    Alex: ran into a fellow who would be interested in a pen-testing class. Choosing a date for that....
    Alex: interested in taking a pen-testing class. Hacking, security stuff
    Jarrod: well, far out. That's about it.
    Jarrod: thank you all for coming out and participating in the meeting

These are the notes from the [https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Category:Meeting_Notes The XXXth Meeting of Noisebridge]. Note-taker: FIXME YOUR NAME HERE; Moderators: FIXME THEIR NAME HERE.
* '''One or two bullet points of high-level meeting summary.'''

= Introductions =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to explain''' [[Noisebridge_Vision|what Noisebridge is about]]:
&lt;blockquote>Noisebridge is a 501c3 nonprofit that provides a space for creation, collaboration, and learning about technology and creative projects. Noisebridge provides space, power tools, and infrastructure to help the public learn new skills and create cool things. Noisebridge continues to exist through and depends entirely on membership fees and donations. Our code of conduct is 'Be excellent to each other'."&lt;/blockquote>
* Introduce any experimental or unusual moderation techniques that may be using during the meeting like: direct responses, limited speaking time, orderless stack, &amp;c.
* Round of introductions (remember, announcements come later):
** What's your name
** What do you do
** What do you maintain at Noisebridge?
** if you are new: how did you hear about Noisebridge?

= Short announcements and events =
* Cool new projects? Something you'd like people to know? Say now, but keep it short! One or two sentences please!
* Any happenings at the space of which members should be made aware.
* Don't hog everyone's time since we all just want to hack!

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

= [[Philanthropists]]=
* '''Invite a knowledgeable member to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank:
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

= Consensus and Discussion =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

== Discussion Items ==

If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

= End of Meeting =

* Reprise of the [[Hackernationale]]. [This is anarchy - we do what the wiki says!]
* [[PGP|PGP Key Signing]] could happen now (if it doesn't happen '''before''' any given Meeting).  Ask others around the space or check the [[PGP|list]] to see who wants in on the action.
* Return the [[membership binder]] to its rightful location.
* Clean and tidy the meeting notes including removing all these really verbose instructions, then save them to the wiki.
* Send a summary of the meeting notes to the discussion list.
* Enjoy the company of your fellow hacker, robot, or robothacker.
* Discuss any items for which there was not time during the meeting.
