Meeting Notes 2010-11-09 
 The 134th Meeting of Noisebridge

== Agenda ==
=== Introduction and Names ===

There was this guy from Noisebridge, &lt;br/>
And he stoppeth one in three,&lt;br/>
And the ones he stopped this Tuesday,&lt;br/>
Were Mike, Rachel, Seth and me&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
John and Al and Milo, &lt;br/>
Kelly, Carl and Mike&lt;br/>
And others too mumbly to record, &lt;br/>
but easy enough to like.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
The HMS Consensus, &lt;br/>
Was the ship they travelled in&lt;br/>
And the niggly details of how and what &lt;br/>
Were mentioned here, therein&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
Colin asked the queries &lt;br/>
As oft the newbie does&lt;br/>
And others explained, in familiar refrain&lt;br/>
How things are done here, because:&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
:We're excellent to each other &lt;br/>
:We rarely ever block&lt;br/>
:We value tools over pre-emptive rules&lt;br/>
:And spurn the key and the lock.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
=== Announcements ===

Neurofog told us that he does not live &lt;br/>
at the 'bridge and never will,&lt;br/>
Much relief was expressed &lt;br/>
Because, it is stressed&lt;br/>
Permasleeping is a terrible ill.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
Frantisek cooked some awesome food&lt;br/>
I may have got his name wrong&lt;br/>
His project noble: building Hackmobile&lt;br/>
For something less than a song&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
Two grand is what he estimates&lt;br/>
Know a bus that's cheaper?&lt;br/>
Shout "Frantisek!", then "Apfelbeck!"&lt;br/>
He's looking for a keeper.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
Frantisek has other plans&lt;br/>
We proposes to cook a Thanksgiving NB&lt;br/>
It won't be arrayed on the usual day&lt;br/>
But the preceding saturdee.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
=== Membership Binder ===
&lt;br/>
The binder was checked, and John was there, &lt;br/>
Read twice, with a singleton sponsor&lt;br/>
Two weeks and another, he'll be like a brother&lt;br/>
And an official Noisebridge Mon-sieur&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
=== What's Going On at Noisebridge ===

The event list was read, too long to give&lt;br/>
Craft, machine-learning and knots.&lt;br/>
Please to repeat lists from previous meets&lt;br/>
If you need to know the lot.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
Probability's added for a Tuesday event&lt;br/>
Or at least that's what the odds say&lt;br/>
Bay Area Hackers are Associating&lt;br/>
On the Second Sunday, monthlay&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
=== Financial Report ===

Seven thousand and nine, hundred dollars and eighty&lt;br/>
Three are in the kitty. &lt;br/>
Send in your dues, lest chaos be loosed&lt;br/>
The results will not be pretty.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
We're running so low, it's worrying&lt;br/>
It's less than twice our expenses&lt;br/>
You need to remit all your spondooliks&lt;br/>
Such slacking is wrong and offensive&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
The treasurer moans! We can't take out loans!&lt;br/>
Our Wells Fargo account's reconciling&lt;br/>
Is in wild dissarray, sad to portray&lt;br/>
And the system, it needs codifying.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
=== Discussion Items ===

John wanted to restart hacking EEGs,&lt;br/>
So we put it in this lay,&lt;br/>
And everyone wassailed that -discuss should be mailed&lt;br/>
And see what they have to say,&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
=== Consensus Items ===

It was announced by Al that he'll repaint the walls&lt;br/>
Over by the sewing&lt;br/>
The pictures were neat,&lt;br/>
And checked at past meets,&lt;br/>
But it's time that they were going.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
:The record shows &lt;br/>
:Al "was not pissed!!!"&lt;br/>
:But hacks always proceed, &lt;br/>
:And art never persists.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
=== Donations ===

The Hackbus is looking for money and time&lt;br/>
and laptops, Pent IV or what have you&lt;br/>
Mario is also looking for laptops, says Al&lt;br/>
For kids to run Ubuntu.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
Keyboard or mouse on U to the S &lt;br/>
to the bus that starts with a B;&lt;br/>
Monitors, ladles and VGA cables, &lt;br/>
Noisebridge will take gladly.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
Thursday nobody put out the garbage cans&lt;br/>
Maybe there's a technical fix&lt;br/>
Mike assayed that the touchscreen displays&lt;br/>
Could show some timely widgets&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
=== Other Issues ===

Low incoming numbers of prospective members,&lt;br/>
Is that a new kind of problem?&lt;br/>
Frantisek shared, but no-one else cared.&lt;br/>
If they wont sign the binder, then screw them.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
Seth says he's going to Iceland&lt;br/>
And visiting their own hackerspace&lt;br/>
You can give him some baggage, to go on his voyage,&lt;br/>
Just say so to his face&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
=== Conclusion ===
&lt;br/>
This started like the Mariner rhyme&lt;br/>
But now I've forgotten the scheme&lt;br/>
Is it ABCB &lt;br/>
Or ABAB?&lt;br/>
Time to call this meeting finis.&lt;br/>
Time, quoth Milo, to smoke DMT.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
:For we're excellent to each other here&lt;br/>
:We rarely ever block&lt;br/>
:We value tools over pre-emptive rules&lt;br/>
:And spurn the key and the lock&lt;br/>
