===== Non-weekly =====
* [[Second Saturdays]] are Noisebridge hackathon:
a casual monthly event
dedicated to working on the space or relevant projects and building
community.  This is a great time to get feedback or help on any projects
you have been considering that center around the space, culture, and
infrastructure of Noisebridge.  You can also help with existing projects
and find out ways to get involved.

=== Discussion Items ===

*Marc talked about a small milling machine ([http://mtm.cba.mit.edu/machines/mtm_az/index.html MTM A-Z]) he saw at MIT Medialab's FabLab. It's a machine that you build yourself like a makerbot, and the materials cost about 500. 
*Can we update the blog easier? I'd like to be able to easily blog things for Noisebridge, but I don't have my own wordpress blog and I'm not interested in having one for any reason other than NB. --[[User:Hurtstotouchfire|Hurtstotouchfire]] 03:43, 8 June 2011 (UTC)
