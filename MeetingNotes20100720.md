=== Consensus items ===

=== Discussion Items ===
* On the subject of charging for classes (and paying teachers) at Noisebridge, which has been recently raised on noisebridge-discuss: Instead of disincentivizing participation with fees and/or suggested donations, lets fund non-exclusionary FREE classes and events via threshold pledges on this wiki! Perhaps after we've got a comfy cushion of >3 months' budget in the bank again, we could use NB official funds to match such pledges? Please don't charge for classes at Noisebridge!
