= Safe Space =

Nb is a safe space.. inclusive as possible.. somtimes that means excluding people who are assholes. ACTUAL safe spacc policy is posted around the space. If you're making someone uncomfortable or vice versa, ask them to leave. Go to #space-guardians on SLACK to report transgressions! If you don't feel comfortable confronting the person, just use the #space-guardians channel.

= Participation =

Steve: Noisebridge is open to everyone. You don't have to be a member or philanthropist to come here and and use all of our cool stuff (except the laser cutter!) from 11am-11pm. We're all collectively responsibile for the space. If someone rings the doorbell, you can let them in. If you can't or don't want to let them in, don't.

= [[Philanthropist|Philanthropists]]=
Philanthropy is a way of saying I am involved and want to be more active and take more responsibility for the space and donate on a regular basis. In exchange you get loads of responsibility and 24/hr card access. 
To be one, you fill out a form, someone vouches for you who is a member, and then one meeting happens (that you have to be at) and people okay it. James and......someone else is applying today. 
Read their names and their answer, members are allowed to block.

== Philanthropy Applicants: ==
* Drew - has been endorsed by Victoria, and (informally) Steve
* James - needs a sponser, someone volunteered for next meeting

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

Membership is similar, but the names get read at 4 meetings and you get two people to vouch for you. Membership means you have magical powers like your brain is uploaded to the noisebridge server to become one with the space, you can block consensus items, and grant people 30day access. Membership gives you more responsibility than priviledge, be a Tank, make friends (being a tank will help). You get questions asked on the 4th meeting which is worse than PHD disserations. TL;DR you would take an orange for the space. Also as a 501c3 being a member is a serious thing and comes with Actual Legal Responsibilities, thus requires more vetting and more commitment. NB runs on consensus. Giving a tour is correlated to being a good noisebridge member, and telling stories, and passing on the cultural immunity, and telling people yes, shitting in the woodshop did happen once. At least.

Member Applications:
* Lizzie
* Miloh, who isn't here

Are there any objections? goes for the next two weeks.
* *crickets*


= Financial Report =
Patrick: We have money, but please give us more - lease is up Sept 2018, we need to either try and buy the building or negotiate the lease again. Need money to be able to do those. Recurring donations are best &lt;3 Money means spreadsheets! people love spreadsheets!
Victoria: a year plus 9/mo is a lot faster than it feels like. Email treasurer@noisebridge.net if you wanna help
donate.noisebridge.net is where you do the money things

= Consensus =

Patrick: in the default world, people make decisions by majority rule, usually. Noisebridge isn't like that, we use consensus, lowercase c, and capital C Consensus. Capital C is like a legal process and big things, little c is getting feedback from people in the space "I wanna tear down the wall, do you have feelings about the wall?" and then you figure out something everyone can live with. When NB wants to do something big we use capital C Consensus for things like rules changes. This happened when we introduced philanthropy. The only thing that will pass is what is okay with everyone in the group. If you have an objection, then you need to be part of the solution. it goes through a series of meetings and once it's gone through two without changes, then it comes to a meeting where you need a quorum of Members. Everyone is welcome to participate, only members are allowed to decide. Consensus is slow and cumbersome for a reason but it's how we make "We" decisions. For everything else there's doocracy and little c consensus
J: We also Consense about membership, everyone gets to participate but only Members decide. consensus is a good measure of the health of the space, we have enough communication going so we know what's going on and talk about it ahead of time so we're not wasting time. 

Consensus items:
* Burn Down Noisebridge?
** instantly blocked
** this was a good test. 

= Discussion =

Longer discussion items belong here.  This is the last part of the meeting so that people can break off and continue their discussion afterwards.


== Discussion Items ==
* Ryan: We have a Vive in Turing, some people have thought about getting a PC to run it and bring some stuff for makerfaire that we made in Unity University, gonna see about asking companies to sponsor/donate so we can build a rad AF gaming pc.
** Noisebridge might really benefit from having a gnarly good computer. Perhaps some tech companies would sponsor a build?
** How can we legally accept donations or sponsorship, as a 501(c)3?
** weekend computer build-a-thon if we get that figured out
** J: getting donations for noisebridge is great, what we ask from companies is no strings attached. Classes are great, anyone who's interested in doing this, J will be happy to be point person tman66@gmail.com locker #11 has info too. @CircuitHackingJ on Twitter
** Drew: when people get sponsored to build PC's it's usually someone doing super custom stuff. There is probably a person like this who exists that we should talk to to ask for parts and shit and also they can build it and we can get a computer. 
** Ryan: building it _by_ noisebridge would be more fun and we could maybe do custom acrylic waterblocks and things. Definitely want the nb logo to be on it, and wants to design a NB logo reservoir for cooling. There's a lot of people here who have the skills that a lot of modder's do too. 
** Talk to Ryan - does gamebridge every Tuesday and will be teachng laser cutting classes, easiest on slack, @pyconaut
