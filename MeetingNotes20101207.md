Meeting Notes 2010-12-07 
 &lt;!-- best practices for meeting notes template.  
 #1 copy the template to the correct date for the upcoming meeting
 #2 edit the meeting notes date to reflect the date of the meeting
 #3 edit the meeting number to reflect the nth meeting of Noisebridge 
 #4 (wish all this was programmatic!)
 #5 this page often 'dead-ends' and is consequently difficult to navigate usefully.  Add and update links in the meeting notes template as necessary to make the notes more dynamic and useful for all

Noisebridge provides space, power tools, and infrastructure to help the public learn new skills and create cool things. Noisebridge continues to exist through and depends entirely on membership fees and donations. Our code of conduct is 'Be excellent to each other'."

*Ruby Tuesdays is now happening
*Carl or Alex is teaching Unity to people who show up on Wednesdays
*Pwn Your Own Wireless security class went better then expected and is expected to be a good lead into Januaries wiretapping class (of which it should be made more vocal that '''noisebridge's open wireless network is not a secure network''')

=== Project Updates ===


=== Consensus items ===

=== Discussion Items ===


*[[User:Nickthedude | Nick]] is wondering about creating a space at noisebridge for shooting videos, ( I have green screen material I can bring/donate) looking for suggestions on a specific location inside noisebridge. Church classroom seems like an okay place because its away from noise most times, but would not want to interfere with classes or have more "stuff" back there. At the very least I'd like to put up the greenscreen material and bring equipment in on an as needed basis. If eventually we decide that this is a good thing maybe move toward a more permanent solution. Sorry I can't be at the meeting in person to introduce this but I have an appointment tonight. --[[User:Nickthedude | Nick]]
