In attendance: Al, Noah, David, Andy, Jake

# No conclusion from Carol yet on bylaws
# Briefly reviewed bank choices. General sense was that most of the banks are good, we should just pick one. Some thought that a credit union would be preferable, but we need to call and firm up terms for bank choices page. Can't open bank account until incorporation goes through in any case.
# We looked at spaces on Craigslist. At least ten spaces passed our first-level filter and will be added to the spaces page. Two especially promising spaces in the Mission. 
# Some of the projects and ideas discussed included (add to fill in stuff)
## New Neal Stephenson novel - now with crazy chanting music! (See Al's blog)
## Reprap self-replicating fab machine.
## "Tell me a story!" stuffed animals for the Playa; thought was that an old iRiver plus separately powered mic in a ziploc bag may do part of the trick. Key issue is control, though.
## MyVu goggles, VGA resolution for $299 and 75 grams total, in context of doing Stross Accelerando-style augmentation glasses. Also mentioned CMUCam open source hardware cameras and Intel Open Source Vision Library.
## Cheap ($15-$50) radio localization devices for use in other projects. David M. has a friend who has done work on localization and can ask him about this.
