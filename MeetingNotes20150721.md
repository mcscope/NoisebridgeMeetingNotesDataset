Introduce new people to Noisebridge and Mongo at the same time. Bi-weekly, 4 hours. One or two folks from Mongo to answer questions.
* Hit record dot org, propose to bring a small amout of money to Noisebridge.. will discuss further

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

= [[Philanthropists]]=
* '''Invite a knowledgeable member to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank: No report this week
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

= Consensus and Discussion =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

=== MongoDB Office Hours ===

Bryan: For MongoDB users, learning how the technology works. If it fits, would it be cool to have office hours at Noisebridge?

Frank: What platforms?

Bryan: MongoDB builds database software and then open sources it. For use on any number of platforms. Typically used for services by startups to get going. General use database that can service small or big companies. Been around for ~6 years or so. 

Steve: This should be subject to consensus proposal. Many strong opinions in the community. Would have to outline more formally what's being asked for. MongoDB is an open source data base. MongoDB the company has a couple products for profit... 1) support contract

Steve: Why the desire to do this at Noisebridge? I am synthesising the Noisebridge Discuss thread. If I were not here, I would have a proposal.

?: Praveen said he'd come next week. Could this happen next week rather than Steve speaking for folks on the list?

J: Let's consider how this effects Noisebridge non-profit status.

Bryan: If you all don't want to do it, that's perfectly fine. If it's inappropriate for Noisebridge, that's cool. Given the vitreol, thought I should give a face to a name and come to a meeting.

Kevin: Generally think it's cool. Sounds like you're coming as a expert to share your expertise. You're coming as a representative from MongoDB?

Bryan: Yes, which would make me reticent to speak on other DBs. Why Noisebridge? If there are people intested in trying new things.. going to groups of people from all sorts of different levels, novice to advanced. smart engineers interested by not working in distributed systems. 

Steve: Could you contribute market rate for use of the space? Something I thought up that would make everybody happy.

Mari: Helping out the space critical. Small porition of budget as donation would be sick.

Steve: We're not trying to make money, and we need money.

?: What if company that made 3d printers offered something similar (3d printer workshop).

Steve: The difference is MongoDB makes a lot more money than small 3d printer startup.

?: I was involved with hacker lab in Sac. Was really free, then they started wanting higher fees, now they're sponsored by Intel, extending out to another facility in N. Sac. It's a balanancing act.

Bryan: We don't have an office in SF. Gentrification is a complicated issue. I've lived in SF since '94, have been subject to and contibutor to gentrification. Understand the need and desire to aley the crazyness of the city. We have not been given special privilages from the city.

Kevin: Recommend consensus not needed, but that everyone should have an opportunity to be a part of the conversation. Let's talk more next week per Ron and Praveen's agreement.

=== www.hitrecord.org  ===

Mari: Open collaborative production company. When art is used in a money making production, it goes to creators.

I would like to make a short Noisebridge documentary to put on hitrecord.org

Noisebridge would get residual income and paied upfront if the media is on a TV show.

Hit Record has been active for ~8 years now.

J: What does Noisebridge need to provide to make this happen?

Mari: Nothing really unless people want to help. I'll be filming, will ask for permission before recording anyone. If anyone wants to join in the project, contact me. 30s of video prior yield $200.


??: Good for Hit Record or Noisebridge?

Mari: Both. If not for Hit Record, I would not be in California right now. Amazing and wonderful community of artists. Feel the same way about Noisebridge. Great way to feed off eachother.


J: If you want to go through with this, send a message to announce and discuss lists. Put it out there, get feedback.

Mari: Cool.


?: Approval of what gets put out. Approval of the message in the program? Sounds like it's part of Hollywood. Message will be shaped and formed. The message that gets put out might not be the message Noisebridge wants to put out.

Mari: I would not have brought it up, if I didn't feel aliged with Noisebridge. Please watch our show. 1st episode of 1st and 2nd season on YouTube.

?: Show would not be about Noisebridge persay. Interested in footage of a laser cutter for instance.

Steve: What will it look like? What will it not look like?

Mari: More alot like B-roll. Unless we do the short documentary thing. Will send links out to episodes and how the profit sharing works. Hit Record is very transparent.

If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

= End of Meeting =

* Reprise of the [[Hackernationale]]. [This is anarchy - we do what the wiki says!]
* [[PGP|PGP Key Signing]] could happen now (if it doesn't happen '''before''' any given Meeting).  Ask others around the space or check the [[PGP|list]] to see who wants in on the action.
* Return the [[membership binder]] to its rightful location.
* Clean and tidy the meeting notes including removing all these really verbose instructions, then save them to the wiki.
* Send a summary of the meeting notes to the discussion list.
* Enjoy the company of your fellow hacker, robot, or robothacker.
* Discuss any items for which there was not time during the meeting.
