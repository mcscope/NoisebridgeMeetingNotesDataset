Meeting Notes 2011-12-13 
 == HOWTO run a meeting. ==

Pick a moderator, and a note-taker. The note-taker should:

* write notes in this page, put them back up online when they're done,
* edit the [[Current_Consensus_Items|Current Consensus Items]] if anything is decided to be up for consensus next week (stuff raised for consensus this week should be publicised for a final decision next week)
* edit the [[Consensus_Items_History|Consensus Items History]] if anything was consensed or failed to consense this week.
* tell treasurer@noisebridge.net and secretary@noisebridge.net if there are new members.

Moderator should:
* make sure everyone gets a chance to speak
* speak minimally themselves
* keep the meeting moving! you're in charge of summarising the consensus, and/or suggesting things that need to be done!
* get the membership binders and ensure they are returned to the black desk

* [[Consensus Process|A brief primer on consensus process]]: Consensus is a process for proposals where any concerns about the proposals are examined by the group and adjusted until the group agrees on the proposal. It is the note-taker's opinion that the contrast to consensus is a system where individuals do not invest the work required for consensus. Rather than invest said (sometimes boring) work someone is appointed to do the work instead. The end result being the people who did not want to invest in the (sometimes boring) work do not have their interests represented and sacrifice a disproportionately large section of whatever was up for consensus. If you think it's a drudge consider the alternatives. Representative Consensus PoC ended, will not be implemented, inherently flawed. /soapbox

Josh: joined EFF and shirt is in the mail; mac relics, writes software, works on projects that… most of the things i work on will be 
used by nobody or lead great change. Mac relics is posix layer on system calls so take untrusted 16k code and only have access to… lost track, 64 k emulator, taking new perspective on emulator that does not boot mac os into window in current environment rather emulate ac toolbox calls so app will be at same level as mac native apps (like Wine but… ) furthet off io future curious about running untrusted 4th party code. Ex… 4th party is ad layer. What if age auth does not trust adverts on page? How to implement… since already using 16k … pay cost of emulation once the virtualsation.. design principle of unix is hierarchy.
No silver bullet on social contracts. The people who implement the system are key to the system. Would block  consensus IF item under consideration was detrimental to community. (does that warrant blocking consensus)
Appreciates value of reality check but blocking…  a block means something requires further discussion or

discussion…

discussion….

money….
