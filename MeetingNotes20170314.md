= Safe Space =

'''Note:''' This section is experimental.  We discussed it at [[Meeting_Notes_2016_06_28]]. We're going to try it for the next meeting, and see how it goes, and then discuss in the discussion section how it went, and how we'd like to tweak it.

Noisebridge is a safe space.  '''Invite a volunteer to describe''' what that means.

Some specific points you might prompt the group to touch on, if it doesn't happen naturally:
* What to do if you feel uncomfortable.
* Noisebridge strives to be radically inclusive. What does that mean?
* Noisebridge has an anti-harassment policy. What does that mean?

*cowlicks - want everyone to feel welcome here. anyone is empowered to ask anyone to leave for any reason. if you see non-cool stuff, refer to signs, and speak up.
*Mitch - want people to know that we do better than society at large at this, and were getting better
*J - once you're in here, you're empowered to "if you see something say something".


= Participation =

Invite a knowledgable volunteer to describe who can participate at Noisebridge, including:
* Describe how to get an rfid key for the door system
* Describe how to get access to slack

*cowlicks - if a member sees you around around engaging, they might offer to scan your clipper card to get you into from 10am-11pm. You're responsible for everyone you let in. Give people you let in who haven't been here before a TOUR.
*Mitch - follow one rule: "be excellent to each other".
*J - if we see you being excellent around the space, we'll give you daytime access. daytime access is free!! 
*cowlicks - get onto slack by coming around for a while. ask someone for access and they will hook you up. we also communicate via the wiki. also is mailing list and IRC channel.
*J - lots of projects going on all the time, talk to people and get involved. Also refill our toilet paper if you use the last of it!

= [[Philanthropist|Philanthropists]]=
* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

*Mitch - dont need to be a member to do anything. philanthropists just get 24 hour access. philanthropist is someone who is sponsored by a member, takes responsiblity for closing space down. been hanging out here long enough to want to really be part of the community. you work out some monthly payment with the treasurer. Philanthropy can be revoked by a member if u screw up bad. $80 a month is primary rate, $40 starving hacker rate.

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

*Mitch - to become a member, fill out many forms and get two whole people to sign them, take 4 weeks after forms filled out, so that you can discuss your memebrship with others. Suggest you hang around noisebridge for a few months before applying for membership. Any member can block a new potential member.
*J - Membership is like a relationship. You get closer.. and closer.. and know each other better.. And now you're in a natural relationship! Our goal here is to build a community. So like, if some member blocks your membership cause they don't know you, that's legit.


= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank:
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

*J says that we are in good standing. No quantitative desciption available.
*Also we wanna buy the building. If you know how to acquire a building, let us know. Also if you know about accounting and stuff, help us.
*Jeremy (adds) - #MakeABillion for other discussions about making large sums of money

= Consensus =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

*Saaaam - consensus is how we dicide how to do things in the space. two types 'little c' : if you have an idea to do somehting, talk to a few people to see if its a good ides, and then do it. 'Big C': for larger things, or stuff that might cost us a bunch of money, write up a consensus item and present it at a meeting. It passes unless a member blocks it.
*Mitch - re: abilty of member to block, anyone in community can be part of the consensus process. we want everyone to be happy with how we do things, but only a member has the power to block, but this shouldnt really ever happen. block is hardcore -- "I cannot continue to be a member of this space if this consensus item goes forward". Blocking a member isn't so frowned upon though, since we want members to be people EVERYONE is familiar with, and comfortable with being a member.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''


= Discussion =

Longer discussion items belong here.  This is the last part of the meeting so that people can break off and continue their discussion afterwards.

*Carla - Re: making tons of $$$$, Do an ICO (initial coin offering) for noisecoins and hope for the best!
*#noisecoinICOIdea on slack
*Joey - get backers for projects via social media. Im gonna do it!
*Sam - wants to make promotional videos for space, if you're interested, talk to Sam and J RIGHT NOW.
*J - (bringing up john shutt's idea) fiscal sponsorship. way for non-profits help individuals with cool projects get financed 
*Corey - free money, non profit skillshare.
*Dimitri - doing research on passive income online. noisebridge coursera.
*Jeremy - there is #education slack channel
*Jervon - is accountant. knows about fiscal sponsorship.
