= Safe Space =

'''Note:''' This section is experimental.  We discussed it at [[Meeting_Notes_2016_06_28]]. We're going to try it for the next meeting, and see how it goes, and then discuss in the discussion section how it went, and how we'd like to tweak it.

Noisebridge is a safe space.  '''Invite a volunteer to describe''' what that means.

Some specific points you might prompt the group to touch on, if it doesn't happen naturally:
* What to do if you feel uncomfortable.
* Noisebridge strives to be radically inclusive. What does that mean?
* Noisebridge has an antiharassment policy. What does that mean?

Don't want people to experience unwanted attention - Be excellent to each other - Be aware of subject matter of conversations around others

= Participation =

Invite a knowledgable volunteer to describe who can participate at Noisebridge, including:
* Describe how to get an rfid key for the door system
* Describe how to get access to slack

Guests - If you let someone in, you are responcible for them.  Welcome them, introduce, give tour, high five
All peeps - Share the culture - not just skills but also ideas, tours, stewardship
General Participant - follow the one rule... ITS JUST THAT EASY! - 11am to 11pm - Clipper Card
Philanthrothingy - Don't have to be rich - pay dues, small - 24hour excess! Closing the space - Wikipage to read and understand - may need to manage people - 


= [[Philanthropist|Philanthropists]]=
* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

Everyone is welcome and can take as much reposiblilty as they like
To become a member, two people must vouch for you
Must carry the same reposiblilties as Philanthropists but more

Members get 24hour access
Members get full concensus
Members are invested in seeing Noisebridge succeed.

Membership gives you a bunch of reposiblilty but 

Miloh is up for memebership, fourth week. Miloh you need to be here to be memberized!

Mitch - You do not need to be a member, to do anything at noisebridge, and the only thing it let you get invovle in consenuship process.


= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank:
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

Mitch - Want to raise money to buy building, and not be at the demand of SF rent prices
Noisebridge Group how to make $1M to noisebridge



= Consensus =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

Just do it!!! The one rule applies... Talk to people present and get small 'c' consensus

If you can tell someone objects but doesn't express it, speak with them and make sure a tact is negotiated.

Big C Concensus - for financial - big decisions - Membership

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''


= Discussion =

Longer discussion items belong here.  This is the last part of the meeting so that people can break off and continue their discussion afterwards.


== Discussion Items ==

Someone was added to the 86 page on the wiki.
Weekly Survey
CJ sez - Is there an application process for teaching a class? - Get students - don't block other people's events.

How do people network with other noisebrdige peeps? Slack is a great way
= End of Meeting =

# Return the [[membership binder]] to its rightful location.
# Discuss any items for which there was not time during the meeting.
# Enjoy the company of your fellow hacker, robot, or robothacker.

== Note taker posts the notes ==

# Fill out the short summary at the top listing just announcements, consensus items, discussion topics, and names of new members and philanthropists.

== Fun things to do after ==
* Reprise of the [[Hackernationale]]. [This is anarchy - we do what the wiki says!]
