= Safe Space =

'''Note:''' This section is experimental.  We discussed it at [[Meeting_Notes_2016_06_28]]. We're going to try it for the next meeting, and see how it goes, and then discuss in the discussion section how it went, and how we'd like to tweak it.

Noisebridge is a safe space.  '''Invite a volunteer to describe''' what that means.

Some specific points you might prompt the group to touch on, if it doesn't happen naturally:
* What to do if you feel uncomfortable.
* Noisebridge strives to be radically inclusive. What does that mean?
* Noisebridge has an antiharassment policy. What does that mean?

Alex: When you are at noisebridge, you are always allowed to assert your own personal space and boundaries. Be respectful of someone's boundaries. If someone's working on something, they have the right to their own space/time/concentration. If you are uncomfortable with someone being here, you can ask them to leave. If you do not feel comfortable asking someone to leave, you can ask someone who is here often to help you out.
J: Once you've stepped foot in Noisebridge, you should feel empowered to say something if you see something wrong.
Tara: Would it be better if we had a code word?


= Participation =

Invite a knowledgable volunteer to describe who can participate at Noisebridge, including:
* Describe how to get an rfid key for the door system
* Describe how to get access to slack

Steve: This space is open to the public 11-10 (except special occasions). If a member feels comfortable with you getting into the space without ringing the doorbell, they can give you an RFID token. We ask for a $5 donation.

Slack access is granted to people who are physically present at the space.

What happens if someone rings the doorbell? Anyone with a keycard can let them in if they feel comforable being responsible for that person.

= [[Philanthropist|Philanthropists]]=
* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philanthropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

Alex: Noisebridge needs money. You don't have to be a philanthropist to donate, but philanthropists contribute regularly, and get 24-hour access. If a member feels comfortable sponsoring you, you can be a sustaining part of the space.

Monthly Donations are $80, or $40 for a starving hacker rate. If you are a googooolor or a facebook, you know what to do. If you're barely making it in this ever so harsh city, you also know what to do.

Up for philanthropy:
Nick Pessaro (Sponsored by J) - "I like long walks on the beach, sunsets, and I help out with circuit hacking mondays. Also purple is #FAKENEWS". No objections.
Joe (Sponsored by J) - "I wanna learn more about all the different areas and teaching people. I found out about NB through Circuit Hacking Mondays". No objections.
Christina Zhou (Sponsored by J) - "I've worked with a lot of different parts of Noisebridge. Happy to help other people out." No objections.

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

J: Membership at Noisebridge is not like a Gym membership. We take membership seriously. It is something like a relationship. It takes time to get to know us, and time for us to get to know you.

Membership only gives you responsibility and &lt;strike>a dreading feeling of regret&lt;/strike> the ability to participate in the consensus process.

In order to become a member, you &lt;strike>invoke the old gods&lt;/strike> fill out a form, get sponsored by two members, and your name is read out for 4 meetings. On the 4th meeting, we grill you and if there are no objections, you become a member.

No peeps up for membership.

= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank:We have $85,411.54 in the bank. $7,552.33 is for the equipment fund. Around $30K is for Noisetor.$315.34 is saved for laser repair.
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

(John, our treasurer, is AFK)
We have money. Give us more money. https://donate.noisebridge.net
We need more money so that we can buy the building.
We have 10 months of rent. This is good, but could always be better.

= Consensus =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

Darryl: "Little c" consensus - asking around if you want to make a change to the space
Lizzie: "Big C" Consensus - a huge undertaking for an irreversible change to the space.
J: Generally, consensus is not necessary if the space is healthy. Unless it's legal or financial, consensus is rare

Steve: Members have the ability to block people who are tripping balls from burning down the space. Also other things.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

None.

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

None.

= Discussion =

Longer discussion items belong here.  This is the last part of the meeting so that people can break off and continue their discussion afterwards.

Alex: We have some VR stuff. If you want to help expanding the VR capabilities of the space, come and see us.

Ryan: Who is interested in funning the kiln off of an arduino? This sounds awesome (and also peak noisebridge tbh) , and I need more control for a specific project I'm doing.
Lizzie: Trent is working on this.
Ryan: I'd also be able to teach people about things like lost-wax casting, light pressure aluminum casting, etc.

Joey: Trying to improve Noisebridge's social media presence, and improve community participation. Things like having events. More 5mof stuff on Youtube? Looking for PR-capable volunteers and enabling participation.
Natalie: If we can schedule Mary Poppins saying stuff, we can schedule tweets as well.
Joey: I want some more authentic community input.
Jeremy: We have #socialmedia on slack, check it out!

Ryan: Last week we got a 360° video camera donated to us. This is pretty awesome. This is an opportunity to produce more content.

J: We need human power to run all of these things. Talk to me, talk to Jeremy, etc.

X?: I'd be more than happy to help with ed stuff.

Carla: I had the idea to run an ICO (releasing a virtual coin). I got connected with Victoria. We had a thing called noisecoin, but it's dead (the tech is out of date). There are all these wierd altcoins/shitcoins. Can we do something similar/better? Noisecoin is built off of Ripple.

J: Let's discus fiscal sponsorship. Fiscal sponsorship is a way for Noisebridge to help educational/community projects get financial backing (ie tax deductability for corp donations). There are many ways to describe the makeup of fiscal sponsorship, scope, and if possible, an exit.
Tara: Do we need fiscal sponsorship to get things like city permits?
Natalie: Anyone could fill out the grant and designate the money for Noisebridge (and it's up to NB to accept/reject it).
Jervon: Noisebridge also has the fiduciary responsibility to fulfill the terms of the grant. If something goes south, Noisebridge will be liable.
Andrew: Grants can be stringent with their terms.
J: 85-90% of the money will go to the cause. But the issue is that accounting is a lot of work. If we get $100k, $10-15k of that will go to Noisebridge, and if need be we can hire accountants and do stuff like that to keep everything cool.

Kevin: East Bay Hackerspace "Liberating Ourselves Locally", a QTPoC-run space, has their landlord selling the building. This is a great opportunity to buy. Visit their crowdfund page https://www.youcaring.com/thetenantsandthecommunity-773671

Daniel: I found the youtube video with a person skating around. I'm happy to have found the space.
