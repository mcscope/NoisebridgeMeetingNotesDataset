Meeting Notes 2011-01-11 
 &lt;!-- best practices for meeting notes template.  
 #1 copy the template to the correct date for the upcoming meeting
 #2 edit the meeting notes date to reflect the date of the meeting
 #3 edit the meeting number to reflect the nth meeting of Noisebridge 
 #4 (wish all this was programmatic!)
 #5 this page often 'dead-ends' and is consequently difficult to navigate usefully.  Add and update links in the meeting notes template as necessary to make the notes more dynamic and useful for all

== Introduction and Names ==
[https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Category:Meeting_Notes The 143rd Meeting of Noisebridge]

Note-taker: Al Sweigart

Moderator: R. Miloh Alexander
 

* [[Noisebridge_Vision|What Noisebridge is about]]: description provided by Adi
* [[Consensus Process|A brief primer on consensus process]]: provided by Adi
== Financial Report ==
==== Treasurer Statement: currently about ~17k in savings ====
====December dues payment: $4360.00 in December ====
this includes some prepayments for next year, meaning the monthly cash flow is currently negative
The treasurer is trying to start tracking t-shirt and beverage income separately 
There was $363 in the Donation bin today (not counted since 12/20)
*side note by miloh:  if members collectively fund %80 percent of the 'rule of thumb' $165/day costs, the leaves about a $33/day funding gap that needs to be covered with donations in order to maintain a neutral cash flow from month-to-month.  This count from the cash donation bin holds only ~50% of this amount (21 days * $33/day = $693), which means Noisebridge will be cash flow negative month-to-month if we only rely on the cash donation bin)
== Membership Binder ==

=====R. Miloh Alexander=====
 (that's me!) &lt;-- these last two guise are 'trying to subvert the pro-cess by becoming members of Noisebridge!'
====others====
Others are still in process and it looks like they aren't showing up!  If you can't show up then make friends with members who can show you how to subvert the process!  If you don't want to be a member but are a regular Noisebridge user,then consider support by monthly donations to close the funding gap.
== Project Updates ==
No project updates were discussed.
== Consensus items ==
==== Board election consensus item discussion ====
Discussion about the voting system for the board Election

Shannon brings up the fund raising drive for a laser engraver:
Noisebridge has attempted to obtain a laser cutter for a while..  last count, we only need $204 for a LASER CUTTER, namely a device to cut things with a laser.
As an incentive, Donor's names will be on a special laser etched plaque above the laser cutter in the laser cutter room.
==== Upcoming Art Night collective event ====

=== Nota Bene ===  
 Question: What does a note taker do during the meeting?

 Answer: The useful note-taker
  Should pass along the notes of anyone approved during the meeting to the current secretary of Noisebridge ( secretary at Noisebridge.net)
  Should record upcoming events, discussion, and upcoming or recent consensus decisions
  Should promptly send notes to the mailing lists: nb-discuss and nb-announce for announcements of important consensus decisions 
  
I'm late with these items and no one should follow my example!
