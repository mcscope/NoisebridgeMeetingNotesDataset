= Safe Space =

* Don't telerate harrassment, opens the ability to discuss what that means. It maintains transparency among members.

* Victoria: so, to me, noisebridge as a safe space means that people are welcome to express themselves in whatever manner they see fit provided that it does not infringe on the psychological safety of others. that doesn’t mean that you can’t offend anyone, or discuss explicit subjects. if you accidentally offend someone, apologize and work on being a better person. if you’re discussing domestic abuse or similar things that are triggering, give a warning that you’ll be talking about it. that doesn’t mean that you /can’t/ talk about domestic abuse, lgbtq hate, racism, etc. a safe space, to me, means that if you’re going to talk about those sorts of things in detail, let people know that you’re going to talk about it in detail so they can prepare. consider a trigger warning the same as asking people to put on hearing protection when you’re about to smash some things in the dirty shop. noisebridge as a safe space should engender that kind of consideration for others psychological safety just as much as one might consider the physical safety of the hackers around you

* Steve - stated "we don't want to be considered a safe space in that it infringes on our rights of free speech.

= Participation =

* Steve: Who can paricipate in NB? Noisebridge does not require membership to participate. Just come and work on cool stuff. Option 2, 3: Philanthropist or member. First step, find a member and they can get you a door token. There is a slack account, but membership to slack is limited. 
* John: Also, feel free to post freely to 'noisebridge discuss.'

= [[Philanthropists]]=
* Ryan - you don't get to participate in Consensus, it costs as much as membership, you get 24hour access, you need to know how to give tours, close the space, know that people you let through the door are your responsiblity. You can voice your opinion at Consensus meetings (evyrone can), but not vote. You only need one meeting to get philanthropist approval. You need a member to vouch for you. 

* Victoria - You need to pay $80 to get a membership as a philanthropis. Three applications ryan, jeremy, razi(?). Any objections to Ryan? None. 
* No objects to Jeremy.
* No objections to Razi.

Note that there is no period to discuss objections to the philanthropist applications without the philanthropist present. Members can revoke philanthopistness. 

* Question (Travon): Need a member to have rights? Answer: Not necessarily, more about duties and responsibility.
* Question: Kiln ready? More in the discussion section.

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =
* Roger (enter scnene): Knowledgable Volunteer, what is membership? Answer: A longer lasting bond with noisebridge. It means that you are a part of the consensus process. You can block consensus items, but you must be sponsered by two other members before being approved as a member. There is a four week waiting period. You must answer 'interview' questions in order

* John: It's not like membership at a gym. Long term commitment to the culture of the space.

* Roger: Third week. I've been coming to noisebridge for about a year. He would like to contribute more. he has helped with the laser cutter, flashin' ..., marker board, and much more.

* Question a hacker: What was your most memorable accomplishment or aspect of participation? What made you want to venture into this commitement?
* Roger: I was out of San Francisco. Coming back, I realzed that this was what I wanted to do and be apart of.
* Kyle's membership: Lot's of work and contributions: sewing classes, laser cutter. Victoria, Steve, and other sponsors ...
* James writes: I would like to reinstate my membership. This is their first week. Feel free to grill.

= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank: John Shutt: Treasurer Report 9/13/2016. $61,923.11 in the bank. $12,200.09 in the equipment fund, and $15,000 to return to Google when they tell us how. Meaning that the general fund plus Noisetor amounts to $34,723.02.
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary): JS: $5,315 if the summary is correct.
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials
JS: Some recent big transfers: $3,644.66 transfer to Noah Swartz, related (I believe) to roguelike conference. Please confirm @patrickod or whoever made the transfer. $1,571.94 to Jakprints, Inc., possibly for t-shirts, if someone can chime in.

* NOTE: 'The details matter. If something looks off in these notes, feel free to ask John for the details."
* Instructions on the wiki in the case that the FBI asks about the Tor node that IS NOT on the premises.
* John would like to note that there where tshirts and stickers ordered.

* Hacker interjects: Could we discuss possible accounting options and systems; I'm an accountant. 


= Consensus and Discussion =

* What is consensus? Tori: Noisebridge decision making process. We are an anarchist collective. Our process is consensus. Consensus means that you propose, ask around, and wait until everyone member has consented. Do-ocracy, ever
* consensus - asking around and getting a feel for everything
* Consensus - Put up your item on the wiki. All members talk and talk and talk, before ... during ... after meetings. It's talked about for at least one week. Is there an issue? We ask this during a meeting. Members can block the item if there is such a block. If you block, it means that the item need to be talked about more because you feel that otherwise the item could be the end of noisebridge.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==

[[User:Pemulis]]' fiscal sponsorship proposal!


Consensus Item: Fiscal sponsorship.

John: https://noisebridge.sandcats.io/shared/OoRFmfyb0O8ZIfufXEajoR7ecV14rQBcTyGQhY4yqYZ

We would like to fiscally sponsor projects. It's currently an informal process, we do it with noiseTor. It's common in the nonprofit world. We could compete for grants, contracts, and further the noisebridge mission  if we were able to engage in fiscal sponsorship. In particular, here is a policy (see John's doc) that has been drafted regarding fiscal sponsorship in order to protect the culture and interests of noisebridge. There would be a 5% admin fee which is on the low end of what nonprofits usually take. We could publicaly compete with SF school distric grants, we could have money for job training, and other classes that noisebridge conducts. We did some napkin math regarding the logistics of buying this space. We have a year and a half to think about this problem, and we have an opportunity engage in this avenue as a proactive line of action toward this end and to provide greater value to the community as a whole in keeping with the culture and mission of noisebridge. We need to be able to raise money for a down payment. Please encourage people who are raising money to give even more if they can. Been studying the department of technology as, essentially, an 'investigative journalist'
approximately $500 million goes to nonprofits to help the city. These services are now going to private companies with closed sourced stacks, tools, and the like. The city is setting itself up for much higher costs in the long run, and we have the opportunity to do some good by taking a role in civic tech. If noisebridge can show that this model worked as a proof of concept, we would have the opportuniity to affect other cities and even at the federal level for the purpose of furthering open source civic code in society.

* Greg: Interjects that this is exciting and affirms this idea.

* This is not about profit centers since we are nonprofit, its about ccreating value for the society and creating income centers. Help bring the excellence of noisebridge out of this space to the rest of the city.

* This is the second week that we have discussed this idea has been discussed during a meeting. We have discussed this for many weeks even before this presentation, but we would be happy to discuss this more.

* Blake: What is the fisrt thing, John, that you would like to use this policy for right away. John: enhance investigative journalism and working with the department of technology with regard to civic services. It is scary how little actual local journalism goes on. The money that newpapers hemmoraged at one time no longer exists. New systems are needed to 
* Tori: Can we sponsor a hacker space
* John: Yes, and other existing hacker spaces without having to fight for our own survival
Blake: What does the legal liability look like if we are sponsoring a group which bombs on a contract.
* John: I don't have an ans
* CPA: I can answer that. Contracts work via milestones. You won't get sued for a bad job. You would get sued if you don't produce anything. You are not as much at risk for poor quality as you are for producing nothing.
* Greg: What is the process for sponsoring a project? 
* John: Make it a Consensus item as if it's am membership, structurally speaking.
* Roger: Asks a question, what happens if sponsorship violates our mission. ...
* John: They must be consensus items, and they will have sunset provisions. These provisions will expire and the project proposals will be reopened as Consensus items.
* John: The policy for projects going forward is that people understand where the money is going.
* John: If something thinks there is something that should be added or removed, please interject/contact me. Under these conditions, I would be happy to continue tabling this proposal as a discussioin item. 
* Tori: Would anyone like to sing the hacker national? ... Going once, going twice, Let's hack!

'''Full text of consensed fiscal sponsorship policy:'''

Noisebridge can serve as a fiscal sponsor for projects led by members of the Noisebridge community, accepting grant money and donations to our bank account and passing it along to the leaders of the projects, who will not be considered employees of Noisebridge.

All projects must be led by people who contribute or have contributed to the Noisebridge community in a meaningful way.

Projects must be in line with Noisebridge’s mission to promote and encourage technical, scientific, and artistic skills through individual projects, social collaboration, and education.

Projects that have a military purpose or police purpose, or intend to seek funding from any branch of the military or police, will not be accepted.

Project leaders must be comfortable with the Noisebridge community knowing how much money their project has on hand, since it will be read out at weekly meetings during the treasurer’s report.

We should subject project proposals to rigorous controls and close scrutiny, similar to membership applications. Every project proposed for fiscal sponsorship must be submitted for full Capital-C Consensus, with an executive summary posted online, and any member can block consensus without needing to propose an alternative.

New projects are expected to have specific time limits on the length of their fiscal sponsorship, such as six months to a year, at which point project managers must get consensus to extend fiscal sponsorship. Projects such as Noisetor which have been found to be successful over long periods may seek indefinite fiscal sponsorship.

Projects that violate Noisebridge's mission, accept military or police funding, spend money directly on political campaigns, operate as a for-profit enterprise, embezzle funds, or threaten Noisebridge's 501(c)(3) status will have their fiscal sponsorship automatically revoked. Fiscal sponsorship can also be revoked by consensus of the membership, excluding participants and recipients.

The administrative fee charged by Noisebridge for acting as a fiscal sponsor will be 5% of all money raised through donations and grants, the same rate charged to Noisetor, the first and so far only outside project fiscally sponsored by Noisebridge. This is the low end of what nonprofits charge for fiscal sponsorship and is intended to cover extra overhead costs Noisebridge is taking on.

Noisebridge does not have any paid staff and does not intend to hire any. We may, however, need to pay for additional legal and accounting services from contractors, which should be covered by the 5% administrative fee. Recipients of grant money and donations through fiscal sponsorship may be legally considered contractors of Noisebridge, depending on the amount of money raised and how it is used.

Any money left over from the 5% administrative fee after paying for legal and accounting services will go into Noisebridge’s general fund.
