=== Project Updates ===

None

=== Consensus items ===

* Should we buy stickers? (Mitch will have details on cost, etc.)

=== Discussion Items ===
* pay a cleaning service to clean the bathrooms?
** [[User:Adi|adi]] got a quote from Santos Cleaning for $150/mo to clean both bathrooms once a week (Sunday noon-ish).
* pay for the PO box on Market St? $240 for 12 months. The address is 2261 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94114 #235A
The PO box place's phone number is 415-626-2575. It costs us $20 a month. This place also accepts UPS packages and is cool with it sitting around for a while waiting to be picked up. Seth will contact the state and our insurance company with our updated info.

* Mitch brings up that we're out of stickers. 2000 red stickers, 1000 white, and 500 little red cost us $700 before. JackPrint is the company we used, and they do a good job. Miloh and Josh recommended another place that was cheaper. Mitch says he'll look into it. This will be a consensus item next week.

* What do we do with hiatus members who are incommunicado? The decision we made a long time ago was that if they were on hiatus but did not tell anyone, then after 3 months of not paying dues they were no longer a member. (This was an official consensus item made at some point in the past.)
