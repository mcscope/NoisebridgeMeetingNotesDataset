* Industrial sewing machine is broken, need a tap and die, but our set has been stolen. None of the others seem to be working optimally right now.

* Linux for newbies class by Eric is gone and people keep showing up. Might want to point that out.
* RAYC has pointed out that people come from out of town for Alex class on unity and he hasn't been showing up, so hopefully he will be showing up in the future.

* [https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/User:ToteStreetStudios Thomas Harper], 3 weeks

= Financial Report =

None of those who should know these things are here. But we think maybe we have about what we had last time. Possibly less, possibly more. 

= Consensus items =

There were no consensus items.

= Discussion Notes =
*Discussion about letting the payphone call in. Getting access code setup was talked about. Nothing really squared there.
* Very, very long discussion about a tag tracking/bug tracking system that (John, who is a US Citizen) has developed in order to track equipment in the space and the status of the equipment. The system is independent of this application. Discussion being used to after meeting.
* RAYC is now going to build a parallel NB wiki.  
* Chris apparently became confrontational with a number of people in the space at 2am some day last week, Josh and others including RAYC, saw this incident and became disturbed. Some discussion and a mediator is probably in order. John and Snail are going to give a run at this.
