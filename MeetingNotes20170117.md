= Safe Space =

'''Note:''' This section is experimental.  We discussed it at [[Meeting_Notes_2016_06_28]]. We're going to try it for the next meeting, and see how it goes, and then discuss in the discussion section how it went, and how we'd like to tweak it.

Noisebridge is a safe space.  '''Invite a volunteer to describe''' what that means.

Some specific points you might prompt the group to touch on, if it doesn't happen naturally:
* What to do if you feel uncomfortable.
* Noisebridge strives to be radically inclusive. What does that mean?
* Noisebridge has an antiharassment policy. What does that mean?

- this was discussed but I missed what was said. Good overview though -




= Participation =

Invite a knowledgable volunteer to describe who can participate at Noisebridge, including:
* Describe how to get an rfid key for the door system
* Describe how to get access to slack

= [[Philanthropist|Philanthropists]]=
* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

* Trent explaining. Asks if anyone wants to explain why NB exists.
* Henner explains. It's infrastructure for people who make things. "Hacking means making cool new things out of stuff"
* Trent explains how to get access to the space with RFID.
* Henner explains that it's not hard to get 30 day access, don't be afraid to ask. Also explaining about what a philanthropist is for the space. 24 hour access and more responsibilities for example closing the space when you leave. Contribute $80 or so. Starving hacker rate is $40 or so.

No new philanthropist applications.

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

Daryl: "membership is kind of like philantropy but you need to be sponsored by 2 members and go through a grueling process where you confess all your sins". Grants you more responsibility. Can block consensus items.
Henner said a thing, sorry I missed it.
Trent: You don't have to be a member to participate and hack.

No new people up for membership.


= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank:
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

*no financial report. Last meeting had ~$80k in the bank. Mostly tor and equipment and rent. Starting to talk about how to buy the building. YES PLS (Trav note). Wow.


= Consensus =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

Trent asks if anyone can explain why we have to do this. Trent says Quakers use it. Also the American Heart Association. A way for people to have equal standing. The process is that if you have a big change you want to make, you write up a proposal of what you want to do. Kick it around, submit it, put in binder. Second week that proposal can be approved if no one else disagrees. One good example would be buying the building. Make sure we all want to do that. Mitch likes to say it's the opposite of voting, Trent doesn't see it as the opposite, but it's different.

NO consensus items right now


== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''


= Discussion =

Longer discussion items belong here.  This is the last part of the meeting so that people can break off and continue their discussion afterwards.


== Discussion Items ==

If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

Chris: wants to get whiteboard paint. Wants to raise $250 for 50sq ft to replace boards in Turing room. Trent thinks it would be great to have more space to write on the walls.

There's a buffet at a curry place? Announced by guy didn't catch his name. He also asked why this is a traditional meeting and not an un-meeting. (It's like an un-conference).


= End of Meeting =

# Return the [[membership binder]] to its rightful location.
# Discuss any items for which there was not time during the meeting.
# Enjoy the company of your fellow hacker, robot, or robothacker.

== Note taker posts the notes ==

== Fun things to do after ==
* Reprise of the [[Hackernationale]]. [This is anarchy - we do what the wiki says!]
* [[PGP|PGP Key Signing]] could happen now (if it doesn't happen '''before''' any given Meeting).  Ask others around the space or check the [[PGP|list]] to see who wants in on the action.
