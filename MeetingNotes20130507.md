This will be discussed more soon!

= Attendance =
* Danny - treasurer, moderating the meetig
* Mike - technowanderer, likely to be wandering away from NB sometime soon. Putting all his energy into his own space. Has directions that are different than that of Noisebridge, and needs to push forth with them. Noisebridge and I have been diverging, not any criticism about Noisebridge itself but what is going on doesn't fit or accomodate me. My techniques and styles are different from where Noisebridge is going. Not to say bad or good, but a stylistic difference.
