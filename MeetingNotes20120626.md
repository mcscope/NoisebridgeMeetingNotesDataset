== [[Membership Binder]] ==
* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Write a check on every open application.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.
* Danny is talking about becoming a member, a proper member
* Danny is reading names
* Ryan - Oakland freeschool free energy - Rachel L is a sponsor
* Jake - Kelly and Leif
* Adam - Softwarey engineer
* Nicholas (Tesla) - Likes electricty
** Tom needs to calm the fuck down
* Isis - It's about fucking time - Tom and Leif are sponsoring
* Blake - Had to move, left cookies
==Isis==
It is consensed to bring Isis's consensus a week early because she is away next week.&lt;br>
Fucking lame&lt;br>
Doesn't hack, just looks through the bios options&lt;br>
She thinks the Noisebridge consensus process is communist, she'll just mostly stand aside&lt;br>
Most likely will never block unless it's to kill her&lt;br>
Miloh is talking and making mouth breathing noises&lt;br>
Isis is a member, yay!
== Financial Report ==
* Funds in bank: $$$15,074.38 $$$ recurring.
ducats in a bucket total like 5,800
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
$1623 ........... 14 PLZ RT
* Yes the US has places that supports Tor, so you can live here.
Please retweet here
== Consensus items ==
* Consensus on Isis' sooner than later
It is the consensus of Noisebridge via Consenso that Isis is a member of Noisebridge.

| Consensus item for next week, proposed by Miloh: Noisebridge should buy 200 t-shirts for $1,377.00

=== Proposals for next week ===
Danny proposes signing the grant agreement as specified [[Grants/tf2012]].&lt;br>
Danny talks about how he couldn't talk about it at the last meeting and now we can so he would like to restart the discussion item&lt;br>
Leif has some concerns about how we're allowed to spend this money due to the wording of the proposal contract thing?&lt;br>
Miloh says some of the money was to be spent about a residant hacker project&lt;br>
This is getting complicated, oh shit.&lt;br>
Danny: emphasized that he didn't propose grant, he was just the person they e-mailed&lt;br>
: why don't we just cut it down the middle + say half goes to operations&lt;br>
then we can have fun with the other half.&lt;br>
Tom: I think we should just put all the money in the account, then we can pay rent... We can all reach a reasonable consensus.&lt;br>
Danny: I know Lief + others are worried the $$ will ahve strings attached&lt;br>
I would be concenred abt all this money going into one project.&lt;br>
...If it was an *awesome* project&lt;br>
snail: I would ask if list all the visible strings&lt;br>
Miloh: Pros + cons have different weights + we can balance them out against each other&lt;br>
Danny: This is more me thinking in terms of what I would approve in concenseus it{s worth bearing in mind, what we would decidse to spend this moebny on through concensus.&lt;br>
: Reminded of cars + horses. deideing whether or not we want to take the money: I vote yes. MaYBE what we should do is put together a small committee  decide what we want to do with $$$&lt;br>
: I think Â½ is a great idea - + then the other half should be spent on robots&lt;br>
Leif: No, that does not sound good to me.&lt;br>
We should have a vew more specific idea than robots.&lt;br>
[Just yell louder.]
Danny: Actual consensus is next week so let's just talk about this  a little more, and then let the main conversation start next week.&lt;br>
Lief: I really hope tht before we consensed on it we have some more solid ideas of how to spend it.&lt;br>
Not inherently opposed to the idea.&lt;br>
Danny: I share Leif's concerns (if I read them right) about the effect of  a wash of money coming in. &lt;br>
Tom: Sounds like no ??? opposiont, folkx just need to work out oppositoin... not now.&lt;br>
Leif: Contract obviously very vague, that's a feature. Money not used for the purposes of the grant gets handed back, but what's the time frame?&lt;br>
Tom: That's pretty standard wording in the contract.&lt;br>
Common language in grants to do a specific thing, ie.e space rocket&lt;br>
This grant is sort of "you're awesome, keep doing that", so it doesn't really apply.&lt;br>
Danny: If it looks like there's no consensus next week, I won't be there to fix or amend stuff, but happy to postpone it another week to work on it when I come back. &lt;br>
I also spoke to the person that said, "we take a long time over these things", and that seemed fine.

Wants to sort hacker alley, jake + miloh helped, might take a lot of space.
