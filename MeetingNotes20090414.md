* &lt;b>Hiatus&lt;/b>: members may take hiatus for any reason so long as they arrange it with the Treasurer.
* &lt;b>Removal&lt;/b>: Members may be removed for non-payment after three months of non-responsiveness.
* &lt;b>Membership&lt;/b>:  The process should be described as a process to get to the goal of having good members, not as the only way; this explaination should happen regularly (when we do the binder?).

* Purchasing additional NB stickers (MakerFaire, ToorCamp, etc., library cataloging project)
* anybody got a truck they are willing to drive for us to get free great furniture? -Steve
=== Membership Committee Discussion ===
* &lt;b>License to Interject&lt;/b>: We should host a class on how to handle social groups and situations effectively.
* &lt;b>Timeouts&lt;/b>: members may be given a "time out" on a week-by-week basis, as the result of consensus-minus-one at a Tuesday meeting.  While on "time out" a member may not use the space and his/her pic/info is on the "wall of shame" on the inside of the door.
