= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

*dan - membership is an awesome thing, everyone is committed to paying dues and keeping things on the rails. the process is filling out a form, your name is read off for four weeks, in this time you can get to know people and let them know you, you need two members?? and participate in concencus
* torrey and mitch - dithering over paperwork half filled out. looking for "doug", need to ask him to fill out the 24-hour form in addition to the 24 hour access form that he's already filled out. in order to obtain this access, you must be apart of the cultural immunity process. a couple years ago, a lot of people that made people uncomfortable here, so there was a reboot, now only people with 24 hour access must read and sign terms of agreement. there's no kind of you do or you don't belong, one rule is be excellent to each other. everyone who comes in gets a tour, and after the meeting people can get a tour to get a sense who this crazy place sort of works. overlapping cultures give the peopele here a sense of a person's integrity. people who belong, bennifit and contribute to noisebridge in a general sense, not financially, taking a class, sharing a smile, keep the enviroment friendly. some people have done some really bad things and have been 86'd because they really just don't vibe along here. things here are free, but feel free to donate. doug hasn't been on the list for a month.

three people are trying to become philanthropists

* henner - trent is getting rid of pests
* dan - downstairs is a strong possibility for us to rent out, and something we should consider investing in
* torrie - patrick emailed the landlord about the place, but has not heard any response, considering ideas for noisebridge go-ers such as studios, and leaving somewhere in three years, like a metal shop, can we afford it, and is it going to be accessed like here or more privatized, most hacker spaces do it, but it's unique since we don't, just waiting on the details for the downstairs
