== [[Membership Binder]] ==
* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process. 
Zephyr explains.

&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>If you want to show your commitment to Noisebridge and the community here without becoming a capital-M-Member, consider being a Noisebridge associate. Associates pay their dues to the treasurer just like members, use the space just like members, and are valued participants in the community just like members. The difference is that associate membership doesn't involve consensus: there's no need to go through consensus to become an associate, but associates don't get to block consensus either.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Write a check on every open application.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

== Consensus items ==
You may wish to '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to repeat '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on the consensus process]].

Sleeping problem:
Leif suggest a Japanese Sleeping Pods. So we can find the frequent sleepers, and
tell them, that they can't live here. 
Eric talks about people sleeping at 3am and 12am, a totally different crowd at the night. But nobody
helps Eric or others people enforce the sleeping rule.
Sleepers are telling sleepers not to sleep in the space.
Sleeping hours move to the daytime too. Starts in the afternoon.

Rayc: Mediate after the meeting.

Music: A 40 minute open music jam, includes a variety of instruments, you have to built what you play.
Basically, allow noise jamming once a week in the space. Open to discussion for the time period.
Somebody wants a parade to append to this live jam. People would be working on their instruments on their
own time. The event will be posted to noisebridge-discuss.
