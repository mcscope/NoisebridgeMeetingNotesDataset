= Safe Space =

'''Note:''' This section is experimental.  We discussed it at [[Meeting_Notes_2016_06_28]]. We're going to try it for the next meeting, and see how it goes, and then discuss in the discussion section how it went, and how we'd like to tweak it.

Noisebridge is a safe space.  '''Invite a volunteer to describe''' what that means. (We don't exclude people based on who they are. The diversity of noisebridge makes it better)

Some specific points you might prompt the group to touch on, if it doesn't happen naturally:
* What to do if you feel uncomfortable.
* Noisebridge strives to be radically inclusive. What does that mean?
* Noisebridge has an antiharassment policy. What does that mean? (Sets explicit boundaries on what "being excellent" means)


We have a safe space working group.  If there is anyone being overbearing, getting on nerves extremely, sexually harassing you, please report to Steve, Torrie, Scotty, or ()    Come to them and they will keep your report anonymous. 

Someone was recently asked to take a break from the space a couple of weeks ago as part of this process. 

If you want to look over the anti-harassment policy you can have a look by the door, where it is posted, or on the wiki. 



= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

There are several levels of membership or participation. 
You can participate and don't have to be a member/philanthropist.
* The note taker is a little deaf. But Jason is describing how you can make things, tinker, and fix stuff, as part of participating! Like a workshop!
* You can do anything you want in the space that a member or philanthropist can do except block a consensus proposal or be here 24/7.  
* You can still support the place with money, cleaning up, organizing things!
* come on in , treat the space and people right. 
* "Philanthropist" level gives you 24/7 access to NB, but you can't block consensus. Being here late hours means, take responsibility to let people in and give them a tour, keep an eye on them, be responsible for their behavior
* How do you get an RFID badge, so you can let people in?

* Being a member (and therefore being able to block) takes a while longer to get and involves a fair amount of trust that everyone can work together
* Only members can get you a RFID badge that will get you in for 30 days from 11am - 10pm. 





= [[Philanthropists]]=
* '''Invite a knowledgeable member to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)


== Applicants: ==
* Joe Nelson applying and has a sponsor. Yay no one objects. Applause, he's a philanthropist
* Colin O. also applying. another guy is sponsoring him. Yay he's a philanthropist! Applause. 
* Jason (already a philanthropist) is interested and will talk with Steve after the meeting
    

== Membership description ==

* membership is an important role and you help make decisions about the space

* to become a member your name is put in the binder for 4 weeks. you need to be sponsored by 2 people. After the 4th week if there are no objections, you become a member.
* Steve recommends you just be excellent for a while and let people nominate you once you've been around for a while. 


= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank:  ???    treasurer not here. But, enough for rent for a few months anyway. Plus around 10K noisetor money. Wow , 40 K?   15 K was from google and we spent some for the giant laser cutter.  Talk with john s. if you have ideas. there is a page on the wiki for submitting ideas on using the equipment money. 
    
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials



= Consensus and Discussion =

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

* what are the plans for the bathroom. jason is interested in fixing it. he knows how to do electrical work. and sheetrock and stuff. who should he talk with? is there a rule for the process of what to do?
** someone else has a plan to put up some sort of plastic panels first
* we do have a do-ocracy so maybe go ahead and do it! 
* Amazing, jason is going to fix a bathroom!

* The nb library is in good shape and there is a flask app you can use to search the library! Howard and ?? are workign on the library and if you want to help, talk with them!  Howard is doing a project to put a label on every book

* Is the game dev thing going on tonight?  Yes! Alex is running it in Turing tonight. 




No new consensus items.

== Discussion Items ==



If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

Scotty: I have a proposed change to the meeting format.
Rearrange the order of philanthropists and members. Philanthropy is a better starting point for people getting started in the space.
Steve: That's a great idea

Scotty: Also, discussing access. Slack access, key access, and general discussion on what it means to participate in Noisebridge.
Alex: Yes. This is always a part of how we define membership/discussion/philanthropy
Jason: Do we have a script/way to discuss these processes?
Scotty: I guess this is what we're trying to do.
Roger: This is great. We have unwritten things that we say every meeting.

* Reprise of the [[Hackernationale]]. [This is anarchy - we do what the wiki says!]
