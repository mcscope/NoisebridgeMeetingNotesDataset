* [https://www.noisebridge.net/pipermail/noisebridge-discuss/2013-February/034588.html Ryan] was not available during the meeting. When we reached the discussion stage of the meeting, some folks said that they had seen him show up to the meeting late without introducing himself, but that he had already left.
