&lt;blockquote>Noisebridge is a 501c3 nonprofit that provides a space for creation, collaboration, and learning about technology and creative projects. Noisebridge provides space, power tools, and infrastructure to help the public learn new skills and create cool things. Noisebridge continues to exist through and depends entirely on membership fees and donations. Our code of conduct is 'Be excellent to each other'."&lt;/blockquote>

= [[ Membership Binder ]] =

* '''Invite a knowledgeable volunteer to describe''' [[membership]], and the application process.
&lt;blockquote>Being a member of Noisebridge is not like being a member of a gym or your local chess club. Anyone can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member for that. At Noisebridge, membership is something different: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community and space better than it is today.&lt;/blockquote>

Membership: big commitment to the space, you get 24-hour access, blocking/veto ability, sponsor philanthropists and other members. Legally bindings, you should know how the space works.

*To apply for membership: fillout a form in the membership binder. Must have two sponsors. Generally should be at the space for at least 3-4 weeks before applying.

* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Mark down a check or other indicator on every open application to keep track of how many weeks they've been read out.
* Anyone eligible to join this week should
** introduce themselves,
** answer any questions members may have for them, then
** leave the area in search of gifts (traditionally beer and a lime, or cookies) for the rest of the group.
* The rest of the meeting should reach consensus on whether they may join.
* Remember to applaud new members when they return.

No new applicants for membership.

= [[Philanthropists]]=
* '''Invite a knowledgeable member to describe''' [[Philanthropist/Pledge|Philantropy]], and the application process.
* Read off any names from the binder for the past month. Any applicants must have their sponsor present to vouch for them.
* If there are no objections, they're a philanthropist! Their pledge should be handed over to the [[Secretary]] posthaste, after which their token will be updated to give them the 24/7 access they've earned(?)

*24 hour access, need to know how to close the space/greet people, means getting more involved with the space and community. 

*Andy Grosser (Not here, sponsor is mitch)
*Jahan Trenbeck (Not here)
*Dave Irwin (Not here)

= Financial Report =
* Funds in bank:
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials

*BROKE as always.

&amp;We need donations, financially, educationally, materially, universally.

= Consensus and Discussion =

*Consensus means everyone must agree on a proposal to the community (new member, other big things.) Little things are generally not consensed upon. Try to work things out before doing consensus. Blocking should be reserved only for things a person is STRONGLY against.

* '''invite a knowledgeable volunteer to give '''[[Consensus Process|a brief primer on consensus process]]
* It is important that everyone in attendance understands at least:
** Blocking with verbalized principled objections.
** Why we use consensus over other approaches to decision making.
** How consensus isn't a legislative process
** Why consensus isn't applicable to some things like conflict resolution, resolution of time sinks, and the like.

== [[ Consensus Items History | Proposals from last week ]] ==
''(Add any items which are consensed upon or someone has raised a principle objection for to the [[Consensus Items History]] page.)''

*NONE

== [[ Current Consensus Items | Proposals for next week ]] ==
''(Add any new items for consensus to the [[Current Consensus Items]] page.)''

*NONE

== Discussion Items ==

If any important discussion happens, it should be happening after forward progress is made during consensus.

*Bring SpaceBridge back --Chris &lt;br>&lt;br>

: Miloh - Back in the day we used to have not one but two space programs at Noisebridge, the Russians and the Americans. Perhaphs this time we can have the Chinese and the Americans.

*Organize the hackershelves -- Zach: The Hacker shelves are a pretty close to my heart and I'm a bit sad that items are very hard to reach at this point in time. Possibly get new location. Would like volunteers to move them so that the items are more accessible. Stop moving them around and find a permanent space. If anyone wants to assist with this project, reach Zach through email (organic_unityatmotherfuckingyahoo.com). He does not use Slack.&lt;br>&lt;br>

: Miloh - Jarrod was planning on a permanent location for the Hacker Selves. It would be a good idea to talk to him about it.
